Using data from the Web of Science MEDLINE database, I used tidytext to examine trends in scientific abstracts on diversity from 1990-2017. Overall, this analysis shows a rise in the use of "diversity" and other population terminology across scientific research. There is a 10-fold increase across the 1990s and 2000's, which mostly occurs in research deriving from westernized biomedical contexts. My colleague - Catherine Lee (at Rutgers) and I plan to continue working on the implications that this may have in and outside of scientific research.
