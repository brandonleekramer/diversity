**Examining the Growth of Diversity-Related Terminology in Scientific Abstracts**

Using data from the Web of Science MEDLINE database, I used tidytext to examine trends in scientific abstracts on diversity from 1990-2017. Overall, this analysis shows a rise in the use of "diversity" and other population terminology across scientific research. There is a 10-fold increase across the 1990s and 2000's, which mostly occurs in research deriving from westernized biomedical contexts. My colleague - Catherine Lee (at Rutgers) and I plan to continue working on the implications that this may have in and outside of scientific research.

## TODO 

#### Analysis files 

- Update data sources 
  - Post data dictionaries as `.rds` 
- Update H1 to reflect `.rds` output files to `data` folder 
- Update H1 diversity in context totals 
  - Should just be a minor change in the percentages df 
- Streamline H1-H3 to only include one phase (for full db)
- Convert analysis process to `.R` files and run `slurms`
  
#### Website 

- Update website files to input `.rds` and plot to make website construction faster 
- Update URL 
- Update project description to reflect MEDLINE data   
  
#### Update README.md 

- Add all the constributions 
  - New dictionaries 
  - Uses full MEDLINE database to study diversity 
  - Interactive website as novel contribution to sociology/STS
