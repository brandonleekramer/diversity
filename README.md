Examining the Growth of Diversity-Related Terminology in Scientific Abstracts

Using data from the Web of Science MEDLINE database, I used tidytext (and a bit of co-occurence network analysis) to examine trends in scientific abstracts on diversity from 1990-2018. Overall, this analysis shows a rise in the use of "diversity" across scientific research. There is a 10-fold increase across the 1990s and 2000's, which mostly occurs in research deriving from Westernized biomedical scientific contexts. My colleague - Catherine Lee (at Rutgers) and I plan to continue working on the implications that this may have in and outside of scientific research.
