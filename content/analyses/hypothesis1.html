<p>Over the past several years, social scientists have noted that the discourse of “diversity” is expanding in use across various social contexts (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=96&amp;v=AyZJdEfYUjw&amp;feature=emb_logo">Berrey 2015</a>). In this project, we are interested in measuring how often diversity and its various metonyms are mentioned in biomedical research over the three decades (1990-2017). Our first working hypothesis is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of the term ‘diversity’ and its related terminology has increased in biomedical abstracts since 1990.</li>
</ul>
<p>To test Hypothesis 1, we concatenated sets of diversity-related terms into 11 categories (aging, ancestry, cultural, diversity, genetic, minority, population, race/ethnicity, sex/gender, sexuality, and social class) and then used natural language processing to quantify the (1) variation of raw term counts over time and (2) the proportion of publications that a set of terms are used in each year. For a full list of terms in each category, see Supplementary Table 1A at the end of this page.</p>

<h3>Raw Growth in Biomedical Abstracts</h3>
<p>The first two plots show how these sets of terms have changed in a sample of ~59,000 biomedical abstracts.</p>

<p>Figure 1A shows the growth in the raw word frequencies of diversity-related terms from 1990-2017. This plot shows that the term diversity has consistently grown over time (from only 2 mentions in 1992 to 381 in 2017). This trend offers preliminary support for H1, but is only one small part of how diversity-related terms are channging in use. Overall, most of the terms in this graph have increased, but we see the most notable growth in terms related to sex/gender and aging research. While this growth is in part because scientists now have a larger dictionary of terms to describe sexed/gendered and aging populations, the focus on these topics is not simply a function of a more comprehensive vocabulary. Supplementary Table 1B provides the totals of top terms used in the aging, class, sex/gender, and sexualities categories, showing that, for example, the use of “women” would have the fifth highest total in the final year of this plot. Figure 1A also shows that terms like population, genetic, and cultural have also risen notably over time while terms associated with race/ethnicity, minority, class, sexuality, social class, and ancestry have all grown at a slower pace than the set of diversity terms.</p>

<p>While the raw totals suggested that diversity-related terms are rising, the proportions outlined in Figure 1B suggest that the sets of diversity-related terms has changed relatively little over time. For example, the terms associated with aging, ancestry, minority, sex/gender, sexualities, social class, and race/gender have stayed relatively stable over time. Perhaps the most interesting trend is the sex/gender line, which rises from 8% to 12% of articles from 1990 to 1996 before returning to around ~8% in 2005. In contrast, the terms associated with population, genetic, class, and diversity have all steadily increased from their baseline in 1990.</p>

<h3>Raw Growth in Diversity Abstracts</h3>
<p>The previous plots demonstrate that some, but not all, diversity terms have generally risen in biomedical research. However, we were also interested in understanding how these terms changed in the context of biomedical research that focuses specifically on the topic of diversity.</p>

<p>Figure 1C one again shows consistent growth in the raw word frequencies from 1990-2017. For example, the terms diversity, population, and genetic exhibit a 12-fold-to-15-fold increase over that time. Sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and aging also increase at similar rates (around a 21 to 22-fold increase) while ancestry, sexuality and most of the other terms display minimal variation over time.</p>

<p>Figure 1D shows proportional growth, telling a slightly different story that Figure 1C, with several nonlinear trends occurring over our period of analysis. First, the term diversity arises in about 75% of abstracts, dropping to 66% at its lowest point in 1996 before increasing to 89% of abstracts in 2017. As a reminder, this sample was generated by searching on the term diversity in abstracts, titles, and keywords. Thus, our sampling method helps explain both why the term diversity is so high relative to others in the dataset as well as why the term does not arise in each and every abstract. Figure 1D also demonstrates that the use of population, genetic, and sex/gender all increase by about 7-8%. On the other hand, the terms cultural, ancestry, and race/ethnicity all follow parabolic patterns, ascending through the mid-2000s before descending to present day. For instance, the term cultural nearly doubles in usage from 1990 to 2006 before dropping to near its baseline in 2017. Similarly, race/ethnicity rises from being present in 3.2% to nearly 10% of abstracts in 2004 before dropping to 6.7% in 2017. Ancestry follows a similar trend rising from 1.4% in 1990 to 4% in 2009 before declining to 2.6% in 2017.</p>

<h3>Main Takeaways</h3>
<p>Overall, our results provide support for the notion that the use of the term “diversity” is increasing in the biomedical abstracts, but when taken on whole it seems that this growth is quite modest. The raw term frequencies suggest that diversity-related terminology has grown dramatically over time, but the proportional analyses temper these findings by showing that some trends, like sex/gender and race/ethnicity, have actually declined in recent years. Future work will need to examine what social, political and economic factors may have contributed to these declines.</p>

<h3>Sensitivity Checks</h3>
<p>While most of our terms are specific to each category in which they are listed. However, the term “minority” is one term that we were concerned about producing false positive results. As a sensitivity check, we found that in the large majority of cases minority was being used alongside diversity, racial, sex/gender, or sexuality terms in our dataset. However, it should be noted that there remains a 2-9% false positive rate in any given year when the term minority does not clearly relate to diversity research. While we considered removing these instances from our dataset, we decided to maintain consistency across our datasets noting that there is likely some noise in almost all categories and altering one category is likely to create problems for accurate comparison across the categories in the plot. The abstracts listed in the following table are examples of the false-positives included in the minority category.</p>

archie cochrane reproached the medical profession for not having critical summaries of all randomised controlled trials, about 14 reports of trials were being published per day. there are now 75 trials, and 11 systematic reviews of trials, per day and a plateau in growth has not yet been reached. although trials, reviews, and health technology assessments have undoubtedly had major impacts, the staple of medical literature synthesis remains the non-systematic narrative review. only a small minority of trial reports are being analysed in up-to-date systematic reviews. given the constraints, archie cochrane's vision will not be achieved without some serious changes in course. to meet the needs of patients, clinicians, and policymakers, unnecessary trials need to be reduced, and systematic reviews need to be prioritised. streamlining and innovation in methods of systematic reviewing are necessary to enable valid answers to be found for most patient questions. finally, clinicians and patients require open access to these important resources.","purpose: in an attempt to understand some of the complex issues related to the participation of cancer patients in phase i trials, and the perceptions of patients toward these trials, we conducted a pilot survey study of 30 cancer patients who had given informed consent to participate in a phase i trial at our institution. concurrently, the oncologists identified by the surveyed patients as responsible for their care were surveyed as well.; patients and methods: twenty-seven of 30 consecutive patients agreed to and completed the survey. patients were surveyed before they received any investigational agents. eighteen oncologists participated in this survey study.; results: eighty-five percent of patients decided to participate in a phase i trial for reasons of possible therapeutic benefit, 11% because of advice/trust of physicians, and 4% because of family pressures. ninety-three percent said that they understood all (33%) or most (60%) of the information provided about the trials in which they had decided to participate. only 33% were able to state the purpose of the trial in which they were participating, with patients able to state the purpose of phase i trials being more educated (p = .01). surveyed oncologists had wide-ranging beliefs regarding expectations of possible benefits and toxicities for their patients participating in phase i trials.; conclusion: cancer patients who participate in phase i trials are strongly motivated by the hope of therapeutic benefit. altruistic feelings appear to have a limited and inconsequential role in motivating patients to participate in these trials. cancer patients who participate in phase i trials appear to have an adequate self-perceived knowledge of the risks of investigational agents. however, only a minority of patients appear to have an adequate understanding of the purpose of phase i trials as dose-escalation/dose-determination studies.","background: human embryonic stem (hes) cells are a promising source for transplantation to replace diseased or damaged tissue, but their differentiated progeny express human leucocyte antigens (hlas) that will probably cause graft rejection. the creation of a bank of hla-typed hes cells, from which a best match could be selected, would help reduce the likelihood of graft rejection. we investigated how many hes cell lines would be needed to make matching possible in most cases.; methods: the number of hes cell lines needed to achieve varying degrees of hla match was estimated by use of, as a surrogate for hes-cell donor embryos, blood group and hla types on a series of 10,000 consecutive uk cadaveric organ donors. the degree of blood group compatibility and hla matching for a recipient population consisting of 6577 patients registered on the uk kidney transplant waiting list was determined, assuming all donor hes cell lines could provide a transplant for an unlimited number of recipients.; findings: a bank of 150 consecutive donors provided a full match at hla-a, hla-b, and hla-dr for a minority of recipients (&lt;20%); a beneficial match (defined as one hla-a or one hla-b mismatch only) or better for 37.9% (range 27.9-47.5); and an hla-dr match or better for 84.9% (77.5-90.0). extending the number of donors beyond 150 conferred only a very gradual incremental benefit with respect to hla matching. a panel of only ten donors homozygous for common hla types selected from 10,000 donors provided a complete hla-a, hla-b and hla-dr match for 37.7% of recipients, and a beneficial match for 67.4%.; interpretation: approximately 150 consecutive blood group compatible donors, 100 consecutive blood group o donors, or ten highly selected homozygous donors could provide the maximum practical benefit for hla matching. the findings from these simulations have practical, political, and ethical implications for the establishment of hes-cell banks.","objective: to explore the opinions of unpaid healthy volunteers on the payment of research subjects.; design: prospective cohort.; setting: southern alberta, canada.; participants: medically eligible persons responding to recruiting advertisements for a randomised vaccine trial were invited to take part in a study of informed consent at the point at which they formally consented or refused trial participation. of 72 invited, 67 (62 trial consenters, 5 trial refusers) returned questionnaires at baseline and 54 at follow-up.; outcome measures: proportions of persons who agreed or disagreed with three close-ended statements on the payment of research subjects; themes and categories identified by content analysis of responses to an open-ended question.; results: a minority (43.3%) agreed with paying either patient or healthy volunteer participants. opinions did not change over time. participants' comments addressed: benefits and drawbacks to research participation; benefits and drawbacks to paying research participants; conditions under which payment of research subjects would be acceptable, and the nature of acceptable recognition. acceptable conditions were to improve problematic recruitment, to reimburse costs, and to recognise participants, particularly for their time investment. both non-monetary and monetary recognition of volunteers were thought to be appropriate.; conclusions: most unpaid volunteers disagreed with paying research participants. the themes arising from their comments are similar to those that have been raised by ethicists and suggest that recognising the time and effort of participants should receive greater emphasis than presently occurs.","despite 3 decades of rapidly expanding application of polydimethylsiloxane as a relatively safe implantable biomaterial, the american public is being told by a vocal minority that its use in the breast implant may be dangerous. most of the furor has been generated by consumer advocates with support of a handful of scientists who have expressed opinions, not well supported by facts, about the risks of these devices. these anxieties have been fueled in the public's mind by a media more interested in sensationalism than disciplined reporting. the controversy has complicated the regulatory process and has become politicized in the halls of state legislatures and congress. remarkably, this controversy has not involved the many other biomedical applications of silicone. how has this controversy gathered momentum? what role has the government played and how have the professional, scientific, corporate, and patient communities responded to public concern? this discussion places the breast implant battle into an historical perspective.","objective: to investigate the nature of physicians' use of research evidence in experimental conditions of open access to inform training and policy.; design: this qualitative study was a component of a larger mixed-methods initiative that provided 336 physicians with relatively complete access to research literature via pubmed and uptodate, for 1year via an online portal, with their usage recorded in web logs. using a semistructured interview protocol, a subset of 38 physician participants were interviewed about their use of research articles in general and were probed about their reasons for accessing specific articles as identified through their web logs. transcripts were analysed using a general inductive approach.; setting: physician participants were recruited from and registered in the usa.; participants: 38 physicians from 16 us states, engaged in 22 medical specialties, possessing more than 1year of experience postresidency training participated.; results: 26 participants attested to the value of consulting research literature within the context of the study by making reference to their roles as clinicians, educators, researchers, learners, administrators and advocates. the physicians reported previously encountering what they experienced as a prohibitive paywall barrier to the research literature and other frustrations with the nature of information systems, such as the need for passwords.; conclusions: the findings, against the backdrop of growing open access to biomedical research, indicate that a minority of physicians, at least initially, is likely to seek out and use research and do so in a variety of common roles. physicians' use of research in these roles has not traditionally been part of their training or part of the considerations for open access policies. the findings have implications for educational and policy initiatives directed towards increasing the effectiveness of this access to and use of research in improving the quality of healthcare. published by the bmj publishing group limited. for permission to use (where not already granted under a licence) please go to

practitioner (gp) must ensure good health care to all patients, irrespective of diagnoses. we aimed to explore patient satisfaction with the provided care and how well expectations in patients were met when no diagnosis was made during the consultation.; method: cross-sectional study based on a questionnaire survey conducted in 2008-2009 among 377 gps and their patients in the central denmark region. a total of 2286 patients completed a questionnaire after the consultation (response rate: 54 %). the questionnaire included four satisfaction items from the europep instrument and a question about unmet expectations. for each patient, the gp answered a one-page registration form including information about the main problem in the consultation, chronic disorders and assessment of prognosis. statistical analyses were adjusted for patient characteristics and gp clustering.; results: a higher proportion of patients reported illness worry (20 vs. 17 %, p-value: 0.005), unmet expectations (17 vs. 13 %, p-value: 0.019) and dissatisfaction with their gp after the consultation when no diagnosis was made. dissatisfaction was primarily related to the medical examination (adjusted or 1.30; 95 % ci: 1.06-1.60) and gp explanations (adjusted or 1.40; 95 % ci: 1.14-1.71). exploratory analyses revealed an association between dissatisfaction with examination and the gp assessment that symptoms were unrelated to biomedical disease. this association was found both in patients with 'symptoms only' and patients given a specific diagnosis.; conclusion: gps are challenged by patients presenting symptoms that do not fit the patterns of biomedical diagnoses. the current study demonstrates more illness worry, unmet expectations and dissatisfaction with the consultation in these patients compared to patients receiving a diagnosis. this trend is true for all patients assessed as having 'symptoms only' at the end of a consultation and not only for the minority group with 'medically unexplained symptoms'. as primary care is the frontline of the health-care system, symptoms are managed as the main problem in almost one in three consultations. it is about time that we take the same professional approach to symptoms as we have done for years to biomedical disease.","objectives: research networks in adult and neonatal critical care have demonstrated collaborative and successful execution of clinical trials. such networks appear to have been relatively recently established in the field of pediatric critical care. the objective of this study was to evaluate the productivity and impact of randomized controlled trials conducted by pediatric critical care research networks, compared with nonnetwork trials.; data sources, study selection, and data abstraction: we searched multiple online databases including medline, reference lists of randomized controlled trials, and relevant systematic reviews. independent pairs of reviewers identified published randomized controlled trials administering any intervention to children in a picu and abstracted data. a research network was defined as a formal consortium or collaborative research group established for the purpose of conducting clinical research. data were independently abstracted in duplicate.; main results: there were 288 pediatric critical care randomized controlled trials published in english between 1986 and july 2015, of which 15 randomized controlled trials (5.2%) were conducted by a total of five research networks. network randomized controlled trials were more often multicentered, multinational, and larger in size (p &lt; 0.001), compared with nonnetwork randomized controlled trials. accordingly, their trials took longer to complete (median, 36 vs 21 mo; p &lt; 0.001). early stopping occurred in 46.7% of network randomized controlled trials (46.7%) and 27% of nonnetwork randomized controlled trials (p = 0.14), most commonly for futility. none of the network, but 45% of the nonnetwork trials found a significant difference in their primary outcome (p &lt; 0.001). network trials were more frequently cited (median, 6 vs 2 citations per year) and published in higher impact journals (median impact factor, 21.8 vs 3; p &lt; 0.001).; conclusions: research networks have conducted a minority of randomized controlled trials in pediatric critical care. they infrequently demonstrate significant differences in their primary outcomes. despite this, network trials are cited more frequently and appear to have greater impact. there are important lessons to learn from both individual researchers as well as research networks that may guide the successful conduct of collaborative, high-quality randomized controlled trials in critically ill children.","background: community advisory boards (cab) are proposed as one mechanism to carry out successful community based participatory research (cbpr), but the presence of cabs may be insufficient to optimize academic-community partnerships.; methods: we conducted semi-structured interviews with minority members of a cab partnered with a hiv/aids research center and identified three themes.; results: first, lack of trust in researchers included two subthemes: researchers' lacked respect for community-based organizations' (cbo's) interests and paid inadequate attention to building trust. second, power imbalance included three subthemes: cab members felt like inferior \"token\" members, felt that a lack of communication led to disempowerment, and held preconceived beliefs of researchers that led to perceived power imbalance. third, cab members suggested best practices, including using collaborations to build trust, actively allocating power, and sharing tangible research benefits with cbos.; conclusions: our findings indicate that cabs must be founded on trust and instilled with power to meet the tenets of cbpr.","background: scientific communities focusing on cancer research have urged for the development of trials that address patient-centered outcome measures instead of solely focusing on cancer as a disease-centered process. this is important for a patient with lung cancer because of the rapid course of disease and generally poor prognosis. we set out to determine the characteristics and study objectives of the current clinical trials in pulmonary malignancies.; methods: the united states national institutes of health clinical trial registry was searched on april 23rd 2015, for currently recruiting phase i, ii, or iii clinical trials in lung cancer. trial characteristics and study objectives were extracted from the registry website.; results: of the 419 clinical trials included in this review, patient-centered outcome measures are investigated in a minority of the trials. outcome measures as quality of life, functional capacity, and health care utilization are included in a small number of trials (20, 4, and 2% respectively). treatment completion is included in 1% of the trials. research goals are most frequently toxicity (78%) and progression-free survival (76%).; conclusion: patient-centered outcome measures are included in a minority of the currently recruiting clinical trials in pulmonary malignancies. if we do not investigate these outcome measures, it is not possible to increase our knowledge of the optimal treatment, as this should aim to optimize the patient's wellbeing as well as the course of disease. one option could be to incorporate combinations of patient- and disease-centered endpoints, for instance by using overall treatment utility or quality-adjusted outcome measures.","objective: to identify factors associated with research productivity among pediatric hospitalists.; methods: we performed a cross-sectional online survey of pediatric hospitalists recruited from the american academy of pediatrics section on hospital medicine from may to august 2009. we used abstract presentations at a national meeting (intermediate outcome) and 22 first-author peer-reviewed manuscripts (primary outcome) to measure research productivity. information was also collected on environmental and physician characteristics. stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify independent associations with research productivity.; results: two hundred fifteen pediatric hospitalists completed the survey. the respondents included 82% in an academic environment, 150% fellowship trained, 25% with additional degrees, and 67% with no protected time for research. fifty-six percent presented an abstract, and 17% had 2 or more publications. after adjusting for potential confounders, pediatric hospitalists were more likely to have presented an abstract if they had fellowship training, an additional degree, were \"very interested\" or \"interested\" in performing research, or worked in a free-standing children's hospital or children's hospital within a hospital. pediatric hospitalists were more likely to have 2 or more publications if they had an additional degree or had presented an abstract.; conclusions: among pediatric hospitalists, obtaining an additional degree and presenting an abstract at a national meeting are associated with research productivity. a minority of this group of pediatric hospitalists had fellowship training, degree training, or 2 or more first-author manuscripts published even though the majority are in an academic environment. these results suggest that structured training and a focus on abstract presentations at meetings could be a programmatic solution.","posttraumatic behavioral and emotional disturbances occur frequently among physically injured trauma survivors. despite increasing investigative interest in the evaluation and treatment of psychological distress in acutely injured patients, few studies have assessed ethical considerations surrounding research participation. the authors empirically investigated ethical considerations in research participation among 117 physically injured, hospitalized, motor vehicle accident and assault survivors. immediately following a 1-hour research interview, participants responded to 10 questions assessing the experience of research participation. the majority of study subjects found participating in the protocol a positive experience. most of the hospitalized patients reported that they experienced control over initiation and discontinuation of the protocol and that they derived benefit from their research participation. a minority of participants reported that they experienced unwanted thoughts and unanticipated upset during the protocol and that they felt they could not refuse participation. however, over 95% of patients reported that the benefits of protocol participation outweighed the costs and that in retrospect they would again agree to participate. these results suggest that while a minority of participants may have difficulties with specific aspects of protocol enrollment, overall research participation is well tolerated by the majority of acutely injured, hospitalized, trauma survivors.","lymphoproliferations are generally diagnosed via histomorphology and immunohistochemistry. although mostly conclusive, occasionally the differential diagnosis between reactive lesions and malignant lymphomas is difficult. in such cases molecular clonality studies of immunoglobulin (ig)/t-cell receptor (tcr) rearrangements can be useful. here we address the issue of clonality assessment in 106 histologically defined reactive lesions, using the standardized biomed-2 ig/tcr multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) heteroduplex and genescan assays. samples were reviewed nationally, except 10% random cases and cases with clonal results selected for additional international panel review. in total 75% (79/106) only showed polyclonal ig/tcr targets (type i), whereas another 15% (16/106) represent probably polyclonal cases, with weak ig/tcr (oligo)clonality in an otherwise polyclonal background (type ii). interestingly, in 10% (11/106) clear monoclonal ig/tcr products were observed (types iii/iv), which prompted further pathological review. clonal cases included two missed lymphomas in national review and nine cases that could be explained as diagnostically difficult cases or probable lymphomas upon additional review. our data show that the biomed-2 ig/tcr multiplex pcr assays are very helpful in confirming the polyclonal character in the vast majority of reactive lesions. however, clonality detection in a minority should lead to detailed pathological review, including close interaction between pathologist and molecular biologist.","to understand the perceptions and attitudes about privacy safeguards in research and investigate the impact of letter-based proband-initiated contact on recruitment, we surveyed researchers in the siblings with ischemic stroke study (swiss). all 49 actively recruiting sites provided at least 1 response, and 61% reported that potential probands were enthusiastic. although 66% of researchers valued proband-initiated contact, only 23% said that probands viewed this strategy as important to protecting the privacy of siblings. a substantial minority of researchers (37%) said the strategy impeded enrollment, and 44% said it was overly burdensome to probands.","as yet little is known of psychological aspects of gene therapy. this pilot study aimed to investigate the attitudes, expectations, knowledge and psychological functioning of participants in a phase l safety trial of a single application of gene therapy to cystic fibrosis patients. sixteen patients were assessed before and after the trial and at a 16 week follow-up using a semi-structured qualitative interview. they completed the family assessment scale, the cf-12 quality of life measure and repeat measures of the hospital anxiety and depression scale and sf-36. most patients had an emotionally driven optimism about gene therapy and few complaints about the procedures in a nasal trial. the majority of subjects were in good psychological/health a significant minority had anxiety disorders and this group were more likely to have concerns over the safety and promise of gene therapy. a preference was expressed for the potential of gene therapy over heat-lung transplantation. results suggest that there are unlikely to be major psychological contraindications to proceeding with gene therapy research in this patient group. patients with anxiety disorders may need special consideration. qualitative data collected in this pilot study can now be used to develop survey questions for large scale studies.","background: the care and support of dying patients and their families are among the most important skills of a family physician. in this century, an increasing proportion of deaths have occurred in hospitals with resulting medicalization of the dying process. hospice care has emerged to focus on the relief of suffering rather than the cure of illness. this descriptive study reports information about the diagnoses, care needs, and attending physicians of a cohort of patients admitted to a free-standing, inpatient hospice program.; methods: we undertook a retrospective chart review of 335 patients admitted to a hospice program during a 26-month period, collecting data recorded on standardized nursing assessment forms. these forms provided information on 19 biologic, functional, and psychosocial symptom groups at the time of admission.; results: family physicians were the admitting physicians in a minority of hospice admissions. pain and mobility problems were the most frequent symptoms encountered. other common issues included bowel, respiratory, and nutritional problems. emotional difficulties were noted less frequently than these common biomedical problems.; conclusions: family physicians should be trained to address core problems encountered in the care of dying patients. multidisciplinary team approaches are essential in the management of many problems encountered in hospice care.","purpose: cancer care spans the spectrum from screening and diagnosis through therapy and into survivorship. delivering appropriate care requires patient transitions across multiple specialties, such as primary care, radiology, and oncology. from the program's inception, the national cancer institute community oncology research program (ncorp) sites were tasked with conducting cancer care delivery research (ccdr) that evaluates structural, organizational, and social factors, including care transitions that determine patient outcomes. the aim of this study is to describe the capacity of the ncorp to conduct multidisciplinary ccdr that includes radiology and primary care practices.; methods: the ncorp includes 34 community and 12 minority and underserved community sites. the landscape capacity assessment was conducted in 2015 across these 46 sites, composed of the 401 components and subcomponents designated to conduct ccdr. each respondent had the opportunity to designate an operational practice group, defined as a group of components and subcomponents with common care practices and resources. the primary outcomes were the proportion of adult oncology practice groups with affiliated radiology and primary care practices. the secondary outcomes were the proportion of those affiliated radiology and primary care groups that participate in research.; results: eighty-seven percent of components and subcomponents responded to at least some portion of the assessment, representing 230 practice groups. analyzing the 201 adult oncology practice groups, 85% had affiliated radiologists, 69% of whom participate in research. seventy-nine percent had affiliated primary care practitioners, 31% of whom participate in research. institutional size, multidisciplinary group practice, and ownership by large regional or multistate health systems was associated with research participation by affiliated radiology and primary care groups. research participation by these affiliated specialists was not significantly different between the community and the minority and underserved community sites.; conclusions: research relationships exist between the majority of community oncology sites and affiliated radiology practices. research relationships with affiliated primary care practices lagged. ncorp as a whole has the opportunity to encourage continued and expanded engagement where relationships exist. where no relationship exists, the ncorp can encourage recruitment, particularly of primary care practices as partners. copyright 2017.

addresses the short- and long-term outcomes of an nci-funded r25 short-term summer field research training program. this program is designed for mph and ph.d. students in cancer epidemiology and related disciplines, in international and minority settings (special populations) in a recent 7-year period. positive short-term outcome of 73 students was measured as publishing a manuscript from the field research data and having a job in special populations. positive long-term outcome was measured as having a post-doc position, being in a doctoral program, and/or employment in special populations at least 3 years from finishing the program. significant factors associated with both short- and long-term success included resourcefulness of the student and compatibility of personalities and interests between the student and the on-campus and off-campus mentors. short-term-success of students who conducted international filed research was associated with visits of the on-campus mentor to the field site. short-term success was also associated with extent of mentorship in the field site and with long-term success. future studies should investigate how field research sites could enhance careers of students, appropriateness of the sites for specific training competencies, and how to maximize the learning experience of students in international and minority research sites.","background: previous evaluations of oncological medicines in the german early benefit assessment (eba) procedure have demonstrated inconsistent acceptance of endpoints by regulatory authorities and the federal joint committee (g-ba). accepted standard endpoints for regulatory purposes are frequently not considered as patient-relevant in the german eba system. in this study the acceptance of clinically acknowledged primary endpoints (peps) from regulatory trials in ebas conducted by the g-ba was evaluated across three therapeutic areas.; methods: medicines for oncological, metabolic and infectious diseases with ebas finalised before 25 january 2016 were evaluated. respective manufacturer's dossiers, regulatory assessments, g-ba appraisals and oral hearing minutes were reviewed, and peps were examined to determine whether they were considered relevant to patients by the g-ba. furthermore, the acceptance of symptomatic vs asymptomatic peps was also analysed.; results: a total of 65 ebas were evaluated. mortality peps were widely accepted as patient-relevant but were only used in a minority of ebas and exclusively in oncological diseases. morbidity peps constituted around 72% of assessed peps, but were excluded from the eba in over half of the corresponding assessments as they were not considered patient-relevant. symptomatic endpoints were largely deemed patient-relevant, whereas acceptance of asymptomatic endpoints varied between therapeutic areas.; conclusions: this evaluation identified inconsistencies in patient relevance of morbidity-related peps as well as in acceptance of asymptomatic endpoints by the g-ba in all three disease areas examined. better harmonisation between the regulatory authorities and the g-ba is still required after 5years of amnog health technology assessment in germany.","what is known and objective: an increasing amount of recently published literature has implicated outcome reporting bias (orb) as a major contributor to skewing data in both randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews; however, little is known about the current methods in place to detect orb. this study aims to gain insight into the detection and management of orb by biomedical journals.; methods: this was a cross-sectional analysis involving standardized questions via email or telephone with the top 30 biomedical journals (2012) ranked by impact factor. the cochrane database of systematic reviews was excluded leaving 29 journals in the sample.; results: of 29 journals, 24 (83%) responded to our initial inquiry of which 14 (58%) answered our questions and 10 (42%) declined participation. five (36%) of the responding journals indicated they had a specific method to detect orb, whereas 9 (64%) did not have a specific method in place. the prevalence of orb in the review process seemed to differ with 4 (29%) journals indicating orb was found commonly, whereas 7 (50%) indicated orb was uncommon or never detected by their journal previously. the majority (n=10/14, 72%) of journals were unwilling to report or make discrepancies found in manuscripts available to the public. although the minority, there were some journals (n=4/14, 29%) which described thorough methods to detect orb.; what is new and conclusion: many journals seemed to lack a method with which to detect orb and its estimated prevalence was much lower than that reported in literature suggesting inadequate detection. there exists a potential for overestimation of treatment effects of interventions and unclear risks. fortunately, there are journals within this sample which appear to utilize comprehensive methods for detection of orb, but overall, the data suggest improvements at the biomedical journal level for detecting and minimizing the effect of this bias are needed. 2014 john wiley &amp; sons ltd.","introduction: public health research, at population and organizational level, needs to be identified independently within 'health' research from biomedicine and life sciences. in phire (public health innovation and research in europe), we investigated the extent and character of public health research calls and programmes in european countries.; methods: country respondents, identified through national member associations of the european public health association completed a standardized recording instrument. public health research was defined, and the call period limited to the latest full year (2010). of the 30 countries included (eu 27 plus iceland, norway and switzerland), there were reports for 25 countries a simple classification of the calls was developed.; results: there were 75 calls and programmes included. of these, 41 (55%) together were in france and the uk, and 34 in a further 14 countries, while 9 countries reported there were no calls or programmes opened in 2010. calls were categorized across diseases, behaviours, determinants, services and methodologies. some calls were broad, while others--particularly in the countries with several calls--were more detailed towards specific issues. levels of funding varied markedly and were difficult to define. where stated, in 32 responses, 19 calls were only open to national applicants and 13 from abroad.; conclusions: most european countries have competitive programmes and calls relevant for public health research, but they are poorly identified. only a minority of countries present a wide range of topics and specific fields. effort is needed to develop classifications for public health programmes and calls for public health research, improve information (including financial) collection to enable systematic comparisons and build greater recognition of public health research within research communities, with national and european research funding organizations, and for practitioners and policymakers.","nanoparticles composed of a magnetic iron oxide core surrounded by a metal shell have utility in a broad range of biomedical applications. however, the presence of surface energy differences between the two components makes wetting of oxide with metal unfavorable, precluding a \"core-shell\" structure of an oxide core completely surrounded by a thin metal shell. three-dimensional island growth followed by island coalescence into thick shells is favored over the two-dimensional layer-by-layer growth of a thin, continuous metal coating of a true core-shell. aqueous synthesis of gold-coated magnetite nanoparticles with analysis by infrared, energy-dispersive x-ray, and electron energy loss spectroscopies; high-resolution transmission electron microscopy; selected area electron diffraction; and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy showed two distinct morphologies that are inconsistent with an idealized core-shell. the majority were isolated ~16-22-nm-diameter nanoparticles consisting of ~7-nm-diameter magnetite and a thick deposition of gold, most often discontinuous, with some potentially \"sandwiched\" morphologies. a minority were aggregates of agglomerated magnetite decorated with gold but displaying significant bare magnetite. both populations were successfully conjugated to fibrinogen and targeted to surface-activated platelets, demonstrating that iron oxide-gold nanoparticles produced by aqueous synthesis do not require an ideal core-shell structure for biological activity in cell labeling and targeting applications.","background: since 1978, the st. jude children's research hospital has oncology education (poe) program for medical and other health professional students to do two-to-four-month clinical and/or basic research rotations in pediatric oncology. limitations in funding, recruitment capability, and faculty interest held student numbers to 0-18 per year.; methods: in early 1997, the program announcement and an on-line application were put on the web site, &lt;http://www.stjude.org/poe&gt;. an applicant's online submission is delivered immediately to the program director's e-mail inbox, promptly acknowledged via e-mail, transferred to a digital database, and forwarded electronically to prospective institutional preceptors.; results: the program accepted 36 of 61 applicants (56% minority) in 1997. a supplemental funding award enabled expansion of the program to include students preparing for health professions or biomedical sciences careers. in 1999, 75 of 139 applicants were accepted (47% minority) from 39 schools in 18 states, the district of columbia, puerto rico, mexico, and ireland.; conclusions: effective use of the web and e-mail made it possible to inform students effectively about the institution and program, match students with preceptors, increase the number of minority participants, and expand the regional program into a national one.","objective: although a great deal of attention has recently focused on 5-year integrated (0+5) training programs in vascular surgery, a paucity of data exists concerning variability of daily assignments in 2-year (5+2) vascular fellowships.; methods: we polled association of program directors in vascular surgery members with 2-year vascular fellowships to determine the number of days in a 5-day work week that first- and second-year fellows were assigned to open vascular operations, endovascular procedures (hospital vs nonhospital facility), arterial clinic, venous clinic, noninvasive vascular laboratory (nivl), and research.; results: of the 103 program directors from 5+2 vascular training programs, 102 (99%) responded. the most common schedule for both first- and second-year fellows was performing both open and endovascular procedures in the hospital on the same day 4days of the week and spending time in combined artery and vein clinic 1day of the week. program directors developed different schedules for each year of the 2-year fellowship in about half (55% [56]) of the programs. a small minority of programs devoted days to only open surgical cases (13% [13]), a separate venous clinic (17% [17]), or a separate arterial clinic (11% [11]) and performed endovascular procedures in a nonhospital facility (15% [15]). all but three programs had mandatory time in clinic both years. approximately one-third (30% [31]) of programs designated time devoted to research, whereas the others expected fellows to find time on their own. although passing the registered physician in vascular interpretation examination is required, there was devoted time in the nivl in only 60% (61) of programs.; conclusions: training assignments in terms of time spent performing open and endovascular procedures and participating in clinic, the nivl, and research varied widely among accreditation council for graduate medical education-accredited 5+2 vascular fellowships and did not always fulfill accreditation council for graduate medical education guidelines. in the current era of emphasis on endovascular-based interventions, few programs devoted days to purely open surgical procedures. endovascular experience in a nonhospital facility (where these procedures will likely become more common in the future), outpatient venous procedures, and designated time devoted to the nivl and research were lacking in many programs. these results provide a valid data set for the association of program directors in vascular surgery to consider establishing guidelines for training assignments in 5+2 vascular training programs. copyright

productivity. study design survey of current otolaryngology program directors. setting otolaryngology residency programs. subjects and methods an anonymous web-based survey was sent to 98 allopathic otolaryngology training program directors. fisher exact tests and nonparametric correlations were used to determine statistically significant differences among various strata of programs. results thirty-nine percent (n = 38) of queried programs responded. fourteen (37%) programs had 11 to 15 full-time, academic faculty associated with the residency program. twenty (53%) programs have a dedicated research coordinator. basic science lab space and financial resources for statistical work were present at 22 programs (58%). funding is uniformly provided for presentation of research at conferences; a minority of programs (13%) only funded podium presentations. twenty-four (63%) have resident research requirements beyond the accreditation council for graduate medical education (acgme) mandate of preparing a \"manuscript suitable for publication\" prior to graduation. twenty-five (67%) programs have residents with 2 to 3 active research projects at any given time. none of the investigated resources were significantly associated with increased scholarly output. there was no uniformity to research curricula. conclusions otolaryngology residency programs value research, evidenced by financial support provided and requirements beyond the acgme minimum. additional resources were not statistically related to an increase in resident research productivity, although they may contribute positively to the overall research experience during training. potential future areas to examine include research curricula best practices, how to develop meaningful mentorship and resource allocation that inspires continued research interest, and intellectual stimulation.","background: chiropractors throughout the world by and large focus on patients with musculoskeletal complaints who are generally in good health. currently, it is widely accepted that neck pain and low back pain are best understood as biopsychosocial phenomena.; objective: the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain psychosocial factors provide added value for predicting recovery.; design: this was a prospective, multicenter, chiropractic, practice-based cohort study in belgium and the netherlands.; methods: a total of 917 participants, 326 with neck pain and 591 with low back pain, completed self-administered questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. they provided information on several demographic, biomedical, and psychosocial variables. lasting perceived recovery was used as the outcome measure, that is, recovery at all follow-up assessments from 3 months on. twenty-seven potential predictors of outcome were used to build the predictive model. stepwise, backward generalized estimating equation regression models were used to take into account the clustering of participants within practices. for assessment of the added value of psychosocial variables, 2 model fit indexes were compared.; results: after the addition of psychosocial variables, predictors in the final model for neck pain included occupational status, body mass index, duration of complaints, previous treatment, and participant expectations (the model fit was marginally improved from 0.684 to 0.695 for the area under the curve and from 65.0% to 66.1% for the percentage correctly predicted). in the final model for low back pain, the selected predictors included country of treatment, age, duration of complaints, previous imaging, and somatization (the area under the curve changed from 0.669 to 0.715, and the percentage correctly predicted changed from 68.6% to 69.5%). only a minority of participants had high scores on psychological variables.; limitations: the reliability and validity of lasting recovery as an outcome measure have not been tested. the cohort needs to be seen as a convenience sample. selection bias, therefore, not be ruled out. there are no indications, however, that patients with complex psychosocial profiles were excluded from this study.; conclusions: psychosocial variables provided little added value for predicting outcome in people who had neck pain or low back pain and sought chiropractic care. therefore, chiropractors should not screen extensively for them at baseline. with regard to the identification of the small subgroup of people with high scores on psychosocial variables and a high risk for chronic pain, further investigation is needed. 2016 american physical therapy association.","zeng et al.'s ethics review highlights some of the challenges associated with clinical research in china. they found that only a minority of published clinical trials of anti-dementia drugs reported that they fulfilled the basic ethical principles as outlined in the declaration of helsinki. with recent reports of scientific misconduct from china, there is an urgent need to find approaches to compel researchers to adhere to ethical research practices. this problem does not call for a simple solution, but if forces are joined with governmental regulations, education in ethics issues for medical researchers, and strong reinforcement by chinese journal editors not to publish studies with these flaws, then research ethics and publication standards will probably improve. other solutions to foster ethical practice of drug trials are discussed including chinese initiatives directed at managing conflict of interest from the pharmaceutical industry and educating clinical researchers.","objective: to describe the effectiveness and safety of surgical treatment of adult patients with strabismus, and to review the reported functional benefits and complications of strabismus surgery for adults.; methods: a literature search was conducted in september 2001. it was repeated and updated in april 2003, with retrieval of relevant citations. panel members reviewed the articles and rated them according to their relevance to the topic and methodology.; results: the literature search identified 49 reports that describe the surgical treatment of strabismus in adult patients and meet predetermined review criteria. of these reports, 2 were of randomized controlled trials, and 1 addressed the primary objective of this review. in this randomized study of adults with strabismus, direct comparison of surgical correction with botulinum toxin a chemodenervation indicated that surgical treatment was superior to botulinum toxin a in realigning the eyes (76.9% vs. 29.4%, p = 0.027). several large case series of adults with strabismus (level iii evidence) with successful surgical realignment rates of 68% to 85% have been reported. functional benefits of surgical treatment are reported in many patients. these include elimination of diplopia, development of binocular fusion, expansion of binocular visual fields, and improvement of head position. surgical complications, including new, postoperative diplopia (1%-14%) or scleral perforation (0.8%-1.8%), occur in a minority of patients. unplanned reoperations (subsequent strabismus procedures that were not anticipated as part of a staged treatment) were needed in up to 21% of patients in large case series of comitant strabismus, and in up to 50% of patients with thyroid ophthalmopathy.; conclusions: despite the paucity of level i evidence from randomized controlled trials, the existing literature suggests that surgical treatment of adults with strabismus is safe and effective in improving ocular alignment. in many cases it improves visual function, based largely on level iii evidence. risks include unplanned reoperation, postoperative diplopia, and scleral perforation. additional level i studies of surgical treatment of adult patients would help to document the effectiveness and substantiate the safety of this treatment.","background: financial conflict of interest in clinical research is an area of active debate. while data exist on the perspectives and roles of academic institutions, investigators, industry sponsors, and scientific journals, little is known about the perspectives of potential research participants.; methods: the authors surveyed potential research participants over the internet, using the harris interactive chronic illness database. a potential research participant was defined by: (1) self report of diagnosis by a health care professional and (2) willingness to participate in clinical trials. email invitations were sent to 20 205 persons with coronary artery disease, breast cancer, or depression; a total of 6363 persons were screened; of these, 86% or 5478 met inclusion criteria and completed the survey. the outcome measures were respondents' ratings on: importance of knowing conflict of interest information, whether its disclosure ought to be required, and its effect on willingness to participate-across seven widely discussed scenarios of financial conflicts of interest (ranging from commercial funding to equity ownership).; results: majority responded that knowing conflict of interest information was \"extremely\" or \"very\" important; a larger majority felt financial conflicts of interest should be disclosed as part of informed consent (64% to 87%). in all seven scenarios, a majority was still willing to participate but in some scenarios a sizable minority would be wary of participation. respondents were more wary of individual than institutional conflicts of interest. illness group and sociodemographic factors had modest effects and did not affect the main trends.; conclusions: the prevailing practice of non-disclosure of financial conflicts of interest in clinical research appears contrary to the values of potential research participants.","research in the community setting is essential for the translation of advances in cancer research into practice and improving cancer care for all populations. the national cancer institute is proposing a new community-based program, nci community oncology research program (ncorp), which is the alignment of two existing programs, the community clinical oncology program, minority-based community clinical oncology program, and their research bases, and the national cancer institute's community cancer centers program. ncrop will support cancer control, prevention, treatment, and screening clinical trials and expand its research scope to include cancer care delivery research. cancer disparities research will be integrated into studies across the continuum of ncorp research. input from current nci-funded community investigators provides critical insight into the challenges faced by oncology practices within various organizational structures. furthermore, these investigators identify the resources, both administrative and clinical, that will be required in the community setting to support cancer care delivery research and to meet the requirements for a new generation of clinical research. the american society for clinical oncology (asco) has initiated a forum to focus on the conduct of clinical research in the community setting. resources are being developed to help practices in managing cancer care in community settings.","this study was conducted as a needs assessment to inform the development of an educational program designed to provide mentorship and skills supporting careers in cancer research, with a focus on domestic minority populations and international settings. the objectives were to determine: (1) the level of interest among trainees in careers in cancer research and (2) preferences and constraints constituted by potential components, features, and duration of the proposed extramural training program. the target populations were participants and directors of federal training programs in cancer research, specifically (1) trainees in the nci-k01, k07, and k08 programs, as well as the department of defense (dod) breast and prostate control programs and (2) pis of nci r25 training programs and federally designated comprehensive cancer centers. we developed, piloted, and administered electronically a survey to elicit perspectives of trainees' career development needs and preferences. response rates from each training group exceeded 65%, with the exception of the k08 trainees (49%). the proportion of cancer research trainees who are interested in careers that include research on us minority groups was 70% of k01 trainees, 72% of k07 trainees, 45% of k08 trainees, and 75% of dod trainees. a substantial percent of these trainees indicated their plans also include cancer research in international settings: 60% of k01s; 50% of k07s, 42% of k08s, and 87% of dod trainees. trainees identified substantial interest in a program that would provide the following: mentoring, manuscript writing skills, collaborative research in special populations, financial support, and focused modular courses. this study offers encouraging evidence of interest which focused in extramural education to augment skills facilitating cancer-related research in special populations.","aim: to study the views of medical specialists on their attitude to and the resources for health research in nigeria and draw appropriate policy implications.; materials and methods: structured questionnaires were distributed to consenting 90 randomly selected medical specialists practising in six nigerian tertiary health institutions. participants' background information, importance attached to research, motivations for conducting research, funding, ethical oversight, literature search, and statistical support were probed. the coded responses were stored and analyzed using the statistical spss software.; results: fifty-one out of the 90 questionnaires distributed were returned, giving a response rate of 63.3%. research function was rated third by 64.7% of the respondents after hospital service (72.5%) and teaching (66.0%). advancement of knowledge was the strongest motivating factor for conducting research (78.4%). securing funding (94%) and finding time (80%) were their major constraints. only a minority of the respondents, 20% and 14%, respectfully, positively rated the quality and promptness of the decisions of their institutions' ethical organs in the highest category. most of their literature search was conducted on the internet (96.1%) and they stored and analyzed their research data with commonly available statistical software.; conclusion: our study respondents regarded research highly but were severely constrained in conducting research by lack of access to sources of funding from within and outside nigeria and finding time from core hospital functions. we recommend periodic (re)training in research particularly on how to apply for research grants and giving some protected research time for nigerian medical specialists in order to boost their research function.","epilepsy is a common neurological disorder. most patients with epilepsy have seizures that are relatively easily controlled, but a significant minority of patients have seizures that are resistant to standard anti-epileptic drugs. the new zealand chapter of the international league against epilepsy (nzlae) has recently been formed to improve the care of patients with epilepsy in new zealand. nzlae intends to work with the lay group, epilepsy new zealand to help raise the profile of epilepsy within the general community, and to improve access to some of the newer drugs that are not currently available here. nzlae is also keen to promote research into epilepsy in new zealand, and members have recently started recruiting patients for several research projects.","the growing complexity of biomedical research requires new methods of discovery; scientists must use an interdisciplinary approach and explore new models of team science, as underscored in the roadmap of the national institutes of health. in march 2003, the national institute of nursing research convened a working group of scientists and clinicians with a wide range of backgrounds to address \"optimizing pregnancy outcomes in minority populations.\" the 2-day meeting included a variety of presentations on the current state of research on pregnancy in minority populations. many participants provided specific insights regarding biobehavioral issues in human-environment interaction, stress and health status relationships to risk, maternal-fetal interactions, and the complications of pregnancy. this supplement presents articles from several participants at this interdisciplinary meeting. the national institute of nursing research looks forward to further collaborations across the national institutes of health and other agencies to achieve the vital aims of this working group.","the special populations networks (spn) project is widely regarded as perhaps the most successful in the history of the national cancer institute (nci) at performing cancer awareness, research, and training activities within minority and underserved communities throughout the united states and its territories. key to that success is the trust established among the community, its researchers and the nci. composed of 18 separate grant awards, the spn project was implemented in april 2000 to integrate the communities' need for cancer information with the nci's need to increase cancer awareness, perform new research, and train minority junior investigators for research in populations with a disproportionate burden of cancer. to date, the 18 networks have conducted more than 1,000 awareness events, trained more than 2,000 community health aides, won 135 grants to support pilot research projects, published 130 peer-reviewed papers, and raised another $20 million to support spn activities. successful implementation of the spn project required the principal investigators to establish and maintain close working relationships with key community leaders and organizations in cooperation with nci.","what has the association of american medical colleges (aamc) accomplished in the last 25 years in its efforts to advance medical education, biomedical research, and health delivery in this country? can the aamc's past accomplishments help predict how it will respond to future challenges? to answer these questions, the author traces in detail the recent history of the aamc, focusing on the expansion of the association's role and constituencies and how these and other changes were precipitated by recommendations in the aamc's 1965 \"coggeshall report.\" he also recounts how the aamc has responded to the pressures and needs of recent years (such as fostering an increase in the number of practicing physicians) and describes in detail the organization and functions of the aamc's staff, with emphasis on its six divisions and the fact that many of the complex issues that confront the aamc transcend the boundaries of governance councils and staff divisions and dictate that association policy be based on broad consensus. looking ahead, he sees at least four important activities that the aamc will continue to be involved with: fostering the education of more minority students; promoting health services research; finding an appropriate role in the evolution of health care reform; and addressing the need for academic medicine to be more socially responsive. the author concludes that the aamc's highly regarded record, its organization, and its financial stability all indicate that it will do well as it tackles the issues on the horizon and others not yet in view.(abstract truncated at 250 words)","objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of bilateral cochlear implantation (ci) compared with unilateral ci for deaf children in the context of the republic of kazakhstan health system. methods. a literature search was conducted, using the pubmed, cochrane, and embase data bases for studies that compared the effectiveness of bilateral and unilateral ci in children. the search included english language, publications from 2002-2012. two reviewers independently evaluated all relevant studies. administrative data relevant to ci in kazakhstan were obtained from the ministry of health.; results: three relevant systematic reviews and an health technology assessment report were found. there was evidence of incremental benefits from bilateral ci but the quality of the available studies was poor and there was little information on longer term outcomes. no conclusions could be drawn regarding later incremental improvements to speech perception, learning, and quality of life. to date, in the republic of kazakhstan there is not full coverage of audiological screening due to the lack of medical equipment. this leads to late detection of hearing-impaired children and a long rehabilitation period, requiring more resources. age of implantation in children is late and only a small minority attend general schools.; conclusions: the clinical effectiveness of bilateral ci, an expensive health technology, requires further study. given the current situation in kazakhstan with audiological screening and access to unilateral ci, there appeared to be other priorities for improving services for children with profound hearing impairment.","community research has been an integral and influential component of the national research program since the late 1970s. institutionalization of community research in the community clinical oncology program (ccop) has resulted in successful collaborations, meaningful accrual, achievement of quality standards, and translation of research into clinical practice. although the national clinical trial system is undergoing modernization and improvement, the success of the ccop and minority-based ccop in cancer treatment, prevention, and control research is being extended to include cancer care delivery research in the newly created national cancer institute (nci) community oncology research program. this article briefly presents a historic perspective of community involvement in federally sponsored clinical trials and introduces the continued involvement in the newly created nci program.","correlative science (cs) can potentially augment clinical trial results by identifying biomarkers of response and resistance to a novel intervention. we evaluated recently published breast cancer phase ii trials (bp2t) to determine prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of cs. through pubmed, we identified bp2t of systemic therapy published between june 2005 and june 2010. a study-specific abstraction tool recorded trial characteristics, cs endpoints, source of tissue, adequacy of samples, biopsy safety, and cs outcomes. bp2t authors were contacted to verify abstraction results. results were abstracted from 298 eligible trials enrolling 18,782 patients, of which 81 (27.2%) involved cs. of these, 57 (70.4%) included tissue with 16 (28%) using optional research biopsies and 17 (30%) requiring mandatory research biopsies. no trial addressed biopsy safety issues. trials were more likely to include cs if they were: industry versus non-industry sponsored (33.7% vs. 17.1%, p=0.0017), neoadjuvant versus metastatic setting (47% vs. 21.2%, p=0.0001), or u.s. versus non-u.s. trials (37% vs. 21%, p=0.005). a minority of phase ii breast cancer trials include cs representing a missed opportunity to learn more from clinical research. when cs is included, consistent reporting of endpoints, feasibility, outcomes, and safety is needed.","biomedical discoveries often provide the basic tools for research. such discoveries may be patentable or non-patentable products or processes, as well as the materials necessary for further research. without rapid access to these materials on reasonable terms, there is concern that the progress of science will suffer. in 1995, the national institutes of health in the united states published a master uniform biomaterial transfer agreement (ubmta) to improve access to biomedical materials. guidelines for transfers were published in 1999. this article analyses a survey that the author conducted in the faculty of medicine, nursing and health science, monash university. it observes that a significant minority of respondents experience frustration and/or adverse effects upon their research as a result of restrictions imposed upon their access to materials. it concludes that the extensive experience and precedent material in the united states provides an immediate resource to help improve access to biological materials in australian universities.","the uh-crc is an nih minority funded infrastructure program at the university of hawaii in partnership with hawaii pacific health, now in its ninth year. the main purpose of the uh-crc is to foster clinical research at uh in order to improve the health of the citizens of hawaii, particularly those who suffer disproportionately from disorders affecting these communities. this status report documents the continued success and progress of the center manuscripts published or in press have increased from an average of 43 in years 1-3 to 54 in years 4-6 to 84 for years 7-9. actual dollars received per year ranged from 1-7 million dollars the first 6 years, but reached 8-22 million dollars the last three years. this status report also documents the mandate for this clinical research infrastructure program to compete successfully for mainstream funding status by 2010.","in early 2001, the national institutes of health (nih) created the research subject advocate (rsa) position as an additional resource for human subjects protection at nih-funded clinical research centers (crcs) to enhance the protection of human participants in clinical research studies. we describe the rsa position in the context of clinical research, with a particular emphasis on the role of the rsa in two of the five crcs funded by the nih research centers in minority institutions (rcmi) program. through participation in protocol development, informed consent procedures, study implementation and follow-up with adverse events, the rsa works closely with research investigators and their staff to protect study participants. the rsa also conducts workshops, training and education sessions, and consultation with investigators to foster enhanced communication and adherence to ethical standards and safety regulations. although we cannot yet provide substantive evidence of positive outcomes, this article illuminates the value of the rsa position in ensuring that safety of research participants is accorded the highest priority at crcs. on the basis of initial results, we conclude that the rsa is an effective mechanism for achieving the nih goal of maintaining the utmost scrutiny of protocols involving human subjects.","background: all medical professionals in the uk who wish to undertake clinical trials involving nhs patients must first obtain ethical approval. although local research ethics committees (lrecs) play a crucial role, few studies have attempted to determine what researchers think about the effectiveness of their ethics committee.; objective: to explore researchers' views as to the effectiveness or otherwise of their lrec.; subjects: 78 experienced medical researchers.; findings: while most researchers did not feel that the lrec made it more difficult to carry out their research, without good cause, a substantial minority was critical of the committee, with many feeling that its approach was overly pedantic.; conclusion: there may be a need for greater dialogue between ethics committees and researchers, so that researchers understand why committees ask for certain information, and committees are aware of problems their requirements may cause.","the author discusses the need to create structural reforms in the nation's health care system, built around a consensus on workable, affordable solutions, the first of four needs in this area, and presents a set of principles that must frame the debate on health care reform (e.g., that health care must be accessible to all americans). he also presents practical options that address the united states' most urgent health care concerns (e.g., making the cost of health insurance more affordable for small businesses). the second need is to preserve and strengthen the nation's biomedical research enterprise; the author outlines steps that are already under way to deal with this need (e.g., the development of a biomedical research initiative in the public health service and the allocation of funds for various research-connected activities). the third need is to increase the participation of minority youth in science and the health professions; the author outlines steps that are being taken to encourage such participation (e.g., helping historically black colleges and universities and funding training programs for training minority professionals in health care). the last need discussed is to foster a culture of character: empowering citizens to take control of their own lives to eliminate costly debilitating illness before it strikes. for all these needs to be addressed successfully, it is crucial that the involvement of the academic health professions community and the community at large be expanded.","some providers will resent less obedient patients, but others will enthusiastically support more individually appropriate solutions and take risks with their patients. it's likely that the early adopters (most likely the more affluent and educated) will soon become a noticeable minority in some physicians' offices.","participation in biobanking among individuals with familial risk for hereditary cancer (ifrs) and underserved/minority populations is vital for biobanking research. to address gaps in researcher knowledge regarding ethical concerns of these populations, we developed a web-based curriculum. based on formative research and expert panel assessments, a curriculum and website was developed in an integrative, systematic manner. researchers were recruited to evaluate the curriculum. public health graduate students were recruited to pilot test the curriculum. all 14 researchers agreed the curriculum was easy to understand, adequately addressed the domains, and contained appropriate post-test questions. the majority evaluated the dialgoue animations as interesting and valuable. twenty-two graduate students completed the curriculum, and 77% improved their overall test score. a web-based curriculum is an acceptable and effective way to provide information to researchers about vulnerable populations' biobanking concerns. future goals are to incorporate the curriculum with larger organizations.","in the era of targeted therapies and combined modalities of treatment, scientific research plays a role of paramount importance in improving knowledge of cancer treatment. the aim of this survey was to review the scientific activity of medical oncology units in sicily and to analyze their needs and possible pitfalls in order to improve future scientific cooperation.the regional section of the italian association of medical oncology (aiom) approved this survey in november, 2007. a systematic review of scientific activity produced by medical oncology units in sicily during the last 5 years has been reviewed. papers dealing with solid tumors reported in the pubmed web site have been included in the analysis. data were reported as absolute number of published papers and impact factor per medical oncology unit and also as a ratio between global impact factor and the number of personnel working in each single unit to analyze scientific production according to the workforce of each institution.we identified a total of 283 papers reported in pubmed between 2004 and march, 2009. the mean number of publications/unit was 10.9 with a range of 0-50. the mean number of publications/year was 11.7 with a range of 0.2-10. the 15 units included in the impact factor evaluation published 252 papers with a total impact factor of 1014.6 points in 5 years with a mean of 63.4 points per institution and a mean of 4.02 points/paper. however only four medical oncology units reported a cumulative 5-year impact factor &gt;100 points.this survey has shown that a minority of medical oncology units in sicily is constantly involved in clinical research although at different levels of activity. overall the percentage of patients enrolled in clinical trials is very low. the main reasons for lack of participation in clinical trials include insufficient medical personnel, the absence of a specifically dedicated research unit inside the medical oncology structures and in some cases lack of research experience and of specific interests in this field.","many studies around the world have looked at the stresses placed on medical students by cadaveric dissection. although these studies have linked the use of cadavers in medical teaching to stress, some investigations have suggested an association with severe psychological stress and even post-traumatic stress disorder. this study assessed the attitudes of medical and biomedical sciences students in an irish medical school towards cadaveric dissection by recording, through a questionnaire, their perceptions and experience before initial exposure to dissection and subsequently examining their attitudes after the first dissection and after 9 weeks. student attitudes towards the dissecting room remained consistently positive for the duration of the study with only a minority of respondents reporting negative symptoms. pre-existing attitudes to the idea of dissection were unaffected by exposure and subsequent continuous experience of dissection. the majority of students in this study did not find the dissecting room experience stressful, and considered time spent in the dissecting room valuable. however, the proportion of students with negative experiences in the dissecting room was higher than has been reported in previous studies. many respondents felt they could be better prepared for the dissecting room experience, indicating an increasing requirement for effective preparatory programmes.

design: analysis of 325 industry documents from the world wide web.; results: in the 1980s australian cigarette manufacturers were informed constantly by the international industry of the medical consensus that smoking caused disease. in addition philip morris (australia) limited received reports of philip morris' international biological research programme and visited its richmond research facility; and wd&amp;ho wills part funded, co-managed, and contributed research to the british american tobacco groups' biological research programme. despite this knowledge, the australian manufacturers had a policy of arguing to their employees, decision makers, and the general public that questions of smoking and disease were unresolved. the industry catalogued the literature, developed arguments against the main claims made by health groups, and attacked public health advocates who made statements linking smoking to death and disease. industry studies suggested that a 20-30% minority of the australian public agreed with the industry on smoking and disease, diminishing across the decade.; conclusion: australian manufacturers were clearly negligent in the 1980s, deliberately working to undermine australians' understandings of the diseases caused by smoking despite their own private knowledge. continuing scepticism about smoking and disease, corresponding with the industry's deceptions, exists in australian smokers today, suggesting that their actions may have slowed the rate of decline in smoking prevalence. these revelations provide important evidence for australian litigation and advocacy.","hawaii established a clinical research center with collaboration from the university of hawaii pacific biomedical research center, the john a. burns school of medicine and kapiolani health via a five year award from the research centers in minority institutions of the national institutes of health. support offered includes consultative services for protocol design; epidemiological and biostatistical analysis; design of study forms; and data and specimen collection and analysis.","we interviewed 64 parents by questionnaire after completion of a clinical trial involving their children for their perceptions and attitudes about informed consent. the results show that only a small minority realized that drug trials are designed to assess not only efficacy but safety as well. more worrisome was the majority of parents who felt that drug trials conducted by hospitals are of no or low risks. moreover, a significant minority offered the view that the strict informed consent procedures we followed were unnecessary because they would do what the doctor advised. even more worrisome was the small percentage of parents who realized that a signed consent form was primarily meant to protect their rights, and only one-third of the parents knew of their right to withdraw their child unconditionally from the trial at any time. these findings suggest that there may be significant attitudinal barriers to parental understanding of the informed consent process.","the competition for funds to conduct clinical research is intense, and only a minority of grant proposals receive funding. in particular, funding for patient-oriented research lags behind that allocated for basic science research. grant writing is a skill of fundamental importance to the clinical researcher, and conducting high-quality clinical research requires funds received through successful grant proposals. this article provides recommendations for the grant-writing process for clinical researchers. on the basis of observations from a national institutes of health study section, we describe types and sources of grant funds, provide key recommendations regarding the process of grant writing, and highlight the sections of grants that are frequently scrutinized and critiqued. we also provide specific recommendations to help grant writers improve the quality of areas commonly cited as deficient. application of this systematic approach will make the task more manageable for anyone who writes grants.","objectives: to investigate attitudes to clinical research amongst potential research participants.; design: questionnaire-survey.; setting: two medical out-patient clinics and the background population.; subjects: a total of 508 randomly selected citizens in copenhagen county (64% responded) and 200 consecutive patients attending the out-patient clinics (64% responded).; outcome measures: attitudes toward different aspects of clinical research.; results: positive attitudes toward medical research were disclosed. the majority found scientific testing necessary, although only a minority considered participation a moral obligation. both personal benefits and altruistic motives for participation were highly rated, whereas former positive experiences from trial participation had only minor impact on decisions. several respondents stated former trial participation had changed their attitudes negatively. lack of feedback of results was of major importance for this change. attitudes are significantly influenced by the presence of independent research ethics committees, whereas trial technicalities such as drawing lots and blinding was found problematic by only a few respondents. altruistic motives of physicians to conduct trials were highly rated by a majority of respondents, but the motive of promoting doctors' careers was also judged important. respondents rated nondiscomforting procedures as acceptable or having only a small impact or strain on their lives.; conclusion: attitudes toward medical research are positive amongst out-patients and the general public. altruistic and nonaltruistic motives both concerning trial participation and concerning the motives of physicians to conduct medical research were rated highly. lack of feedback concerning results of trials to participants was important for a negative change in attitude toward participation.","the exceptional properties of graphene enable applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy storage, and structural composites. here we demonstrate a 3d printable graphene (3dg) composite consisting of majority graphene and minority polylactide-co-glycolide, a biocompatible elastomer, 3d-printed from a liquid ink. this ink can be utilized under ambient conditions via extrusion-based 3d printing to create graphene structures with features as small as 100 mum composed of as few as two layers (&lt;300 mum thick object) or many hundreds of layers (&gt;10 cm thick object). the resulting 3dg material is mechanically robust and flexible while retaining electrical conductivities greater than 800 s/m, an order of magnitude increase over previously reported 3d-printed carbon materials. in vitro experiments in simple growth medium, in the absence of neurogenic stimuli, reveal that 3dg supports human mesenchymal stem cell (hmsc) adhesion, viability, proliferation, and neurogenic differentiation with significant upregulation of glial and neuronal genes. this coincides with hmscs adopting highly elongated morphologies with features similar to axons and presynaptic terminals. in vivo experiments indicate that 3dg has promising biocompatibility over the course of at least 30 days. surgical tests using a human cadaver nerve model also illustrate that 3dg has exceptional handling characteristics and can be intraoperatively manipulated and applied to fine surgical procedures. with this unique set of properties, combined with ease of fabrication, 3dg could be applied toward the design and fabrication of a wide range of functional electronic, biological, and bioelectronic medical and nonmedical devices.","background: genetic association studies are widely used in biomedical research and yet only a minority of positive findings stand the test of replication. i explored the capacity of association studies to produce false positive findings and the impact of various definitions of replication.; methods: genetically realistic simulation data of a typical genotyping/analytic approach for 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in comt, a commonly studied candidate gene.; results: candidate gene studies like those simulated here are highly likely to produce one or more false positive findings at alpha &lt; or = .05, the pattern of findings can often be \"compelling\" or \"intriguing,\" and false positive findings propagate and confuse the literature unless the definition of replication is precise.; conclusions: findings from single association studies constitute \"tentative knowledge\" and must be interpreted with exceptional caution. for the association method to function as intended, every statistical comparison must be tracked and reported, and integrated replication is essential. precise replication (the same snps, phenotype, and direction of association) is required in the interpretation of multiple association studies.","most accounts of the cultural stigmas associated with aids have not adequately considered the meanings through which the stigmatizing self imagines his/her difference from the stigmatized other. this paper argues that 'health' is a key concept in the fashioning of identity for the modern and contemporary middle class and that the 'unhealthy' come to be represented as the other of this self. 'healthy' and 'unhealthy,' however, must be understood both in their biomedical meanings and in their implicit metaphorical meanings. the 'unhealthy,' 'contagious,' 'sexually deviant,' and 'addicted-minority' other--all condensed in the negative symbolism of aids--have become images which are mobilized as part of a cultural politics of reconstructing the self in conformity with intensified mandates for self-control. the expulsion of 'unhealthy' meanings from the self, an act of patrolling the borders of identity, finds its projected physical location in the figure of the person with hiv-aids.","the scope of preschool children with biological risk and social disadvantage is large and includes over 1 million (28%) newborns per year. currently in 1996, 7% of children are born with low birth weight, 1% are born with very low birth weight, 20% have alcohol exposure, and 10% have other drug exposure. poverty is dynamic and impacts on 25% of children less than 6 years old with increased frequency in children who are minority, have mothers with less than a high school education, or are unmarried. there has been a markedly increased survival in very low birth weight and extremely low birth weight infants in the past 10 years. outcomes of these neonatal populations reveals that parenchymal brain injury is the major predictor of cerebral palsy which occurs in 7% to 10% of very low birth weight survivors. however, poverty is the major predictor of low iq. fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in 1.9 per 1,000 births and is most often associated with mild mental retardation and educational underachievement. studies investigating cocaine revealed that it is a multifactorial problem overlapping with polysubstance abuse and other risk factors for social disadvantage. the overwhelming number of children do not have cerebral palsy or severe mental retardation. the long-term impact is more subtle and needs more systematic analysis as well as critical evaluation of cognitive impairments and educational under-achievement. hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (hie) cannot be determined by one biological measure. though multiple disability occurs in 70% of children with sarnat stage 3 hie, 30% of survivors are not disabled. children with mild to moderate hie have long-term outcomes that are influenced by 9- to 12-month neurodevelopmental status and social disadvantage. by combining strategies to lessen biological risks and enhance developmentally appropriate environments, long-term outcomes of preschool children can be optimized.","purpose: to document the process and implications of obtaining written parental consent for school-based health surveys of young adolescents.; methods: as part of the evaluation of the reach for health prevention program, written parental permission was obtained for student participation in school-based health surveys conducted for three cohorts of seventh graders (n = 3253) enrolled in three urban schools serving predominately economically disadvantaged minority adolescents. students in general, bilingual, and special education classes were eligible to participate. rates were recorded for the number of forms returned by parents, parental consents and refusals, student consents and refusals, and surveys completed. procedures for achieving acceptable rates of written parental permission and survey completion included daily communication between research and school staff during the consent form collection period, student and teacher incentives, provision of alternate activities for students without consent, and scheduling of multiple makeup surveys for absentee students.; results: survey completion rates met or exceeded preset goals and ranged from a low of 70% for cohort a to a high of 83% for cohort c. at least 89% of the parents in each cohort returned forms. of forms returned, parent refusals ranged from a high of 18% (cohort a) to a low of 12% (cohort c).; conclusions: obtaining written permission from parents for young adolescents to participate in school-based health surveys is possible in urban settings and has potential benefits in terms of community awareness and involvement in research and evaluation studies. it does, however, require a substantial commitment of program resources as well as significant planning and data collection prior to actual survey administration.","lasers have been competing with non-laser intense pulsed light (ipl) sources in the cosmetic arena over the past 10 years. initially ipls were somewhat cumbersome and accepted by a minority of \"serious\" practitioners. recently, however, the popularity of full-face visible light skin rejuvenation, enhanced engineering of ipls, and favorable cost versus many lasers, have lead to a proliferation of ipl devices. no longer a stepchild in the rejuvenation market, ipls may overtake lasers as the devices of choice among most physicians. we review the pros and cons of lasers and ipls within the context of design, cost, and other practical concerns for a typical office-based practice. copyright 2006 wiley-liss, inc.","there is growing evidence that the outcomes of health care for seniors are dependent not only upon patients' physical health status and the administration of care for their biomedical needs, but also upon care for patients' psychosocial needs and attention to their social, economic, cultural, and psychological vulnerabilities. even when older patients have appropriate access to medical services, they also need effective and empathic communication as an essential part of their treatment. older patients who are socially isolated, emotionally vulnerable, and economically disadvantaged are particularly in need of the social, emotional, and practical support that sensitive provider-patient communication can provide. in this review paper, we examine the complexities of communication between physicians and their older patients, and consider some of the particular challenges that manifest in providers' interactions with their older patients, particularly those who are socially isolated, suffering from depression, or of minority status or low income. this review offers guidelines for improved physician-older patient communication in medical practice, and examines interventions to coordinate care for older patients on multiple dimensions of a biopsychosocial model of health care.","background: most babies are born healthy and grow and develop normally through childhood. there are, however, clearly identifiable high-risk groups of survivors, such as those born preterm or with ill-health, who are destined to have higher than expected rates of health or developmental problems, and for whom more structured and specialised follow-up programs are warranted.; discussion: this paper presents the results of a two-day workshop held in melbourne, australia, to discuss neonatal populations in need of more structured follow-up and why, in addition to how, such a follow-up programme might be structured. issues discussed included the ages of follow-up, and the personnel and assessment tools that might be required. challenges for translating results into both clinical practice and research were identified. further issues covered included information sharing, best practice for families and research gaps.; summary: a substantial minority of high-risk children has long-term medical, developmental and psychological adverse outcomes and will consume extensive health and education services as they grow older. early intervention to prevent adverse outcomes and the effective integration of services once problems are identified may reduce the prevalence and severity of certain outcomes, and will contribute to an efficient and effective use of health resources. the shared long-term goal for families and professionals is to work toward ensuring that high risk children maximise their potential and become productive and valued members of society.","variation in the human genome is a most important cause of variable response to drugs and other xenobiotics. susceptibility to almost all diseases is determined to some extent by genetic variation. driven by the advances in molecular biology, pharmacogenetics has evolved within the past 40 years from a niche discipline to a major driving force of clinical pharmacology, and it is currently one of the most actively pursued disciplines in applied biomedical research in general. nowadays we can assess more than 1,000,000 polymorphisms or the expression of more than 25,000 genes in each participant of a clinical study -- at affordable costs. this has not yet significantly changed common therapeutic practices, but a number of physicians are starting to consider polymorphisms, such as those in cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6, tpmt and vkorc1, in daily medical practice. more obviously, pharmacogenetics has changed the practices and requirements in preclinical and clinical drug research; large clinical trials without a pharmacogenomic add-on appear to have become the minority. this review is about how the discipline of pharmacogenetics has evolved from the analysis of single proteins to current approaches involving the broad analyses of the entire genome and of all mrna species or all metabolites and other approaches aimed at trying to understand the entire biological system. pharmacogenetics and genomics are becoming substantially integrated fields of the profession of clinical pharmacology, and education in the relevant methods, knowledge and concepts form an indispensable part of the clinical pharmacology curriculum and the professional life of pharmacologists from early drug discovery to pharmacovigilance.","research ethics committees - animal ethics committees (aecs) for animal-based research and institutional research boards (irbs) for human subjects - have a key role in research governance, but there has been little study of the factors influencing their effectiveness. the objectives of this study were to examine how the effectiveness of a research ethics committee is influenced by committee composition and dynamics, recruitment of members, workload, participation level and member turnover. as a model, 28 members of aecs at four universities in western canada were interviewed. committees were selected to represent variation in the number and type of protocols reviewed, and participants were selected to include different types of committee members. we found that a bias towards institutional or scientific interests may result from (1) a preponderance of institutional and scientist members, (2) an intimidating atmosphere for community members and other minority members, (3) recruitment of community members who are affiliated with the institution and (4) members joining for reasons other than to fulfil the committee mandate. thoroughness of protocol review may be influenced by heavy workloads, type of review process and lack of full committee participation. these results, together with results from the literature on research ethics committees, suggested potential ways to improve the effectiveness of research ethics committees.","medical training has traditionally focused on diagnosis and treatment of disease, with the notion that if these two factors are satisfactorily managed, the desired outcome will inevitably follow. when it does not, failure is often blamed on patient noncompliance. failure of patients to return for follow-up visits or comply with medication regimens has been shown to be a major barrier to the delivery of effective medical care. however, effective clinical decision making requires that physicians skillfully address not only the biomedical aspects of diseases and their management, but also the sociobehavorial characteristics of patients. the authors maintain that patient participation is necessary for compliance and that a naturally occurring therapeutic alliance between physician and patient incorporates factors such as lifestyle, family, and living circumstances and an awareness of the culturally unique needs of minority patients. integration of these factors into professional decision making and practical management plans will enhance patient compliance.","objective: to determine public attitudes towards emergency research, exception from informed consent (efic) and a specific proposed clinical trial using efic.; methods: as part of a planned community consultation activity, a survey was conducted at a popular public venue. participants answered demographic questions and then were asked their opinions on specifically described consent circumstances in emergency research, including the proposed efic trial. multiple logistic and linear regression were used to determine respondent characteristics associated with specific attitudes.; results: 1901 surveys were completed. the majority of respondents supported emergency research (88%) and the concept of surrogate consent by a legally authorized representative (78%). the concept of efic was less well supported (35%) but the application of efic was more accepted, especially when efic was applied to the respondent themselves (51%). the community believed the proposed efic study was acceptable (82%); a minority had concerns but most were related to patient safety and not to efic. respondents with less education and lower incomes were less likely to express opinions about the consent and research concepts described.; conclusions: emergency research and the proposed efic trial is supported in this community. the concept of efic is less well supported but is more acceptable when a specific trial is described or when respondents consider efic for themselves. specific respondent characteristics are associated with attitudes about research; this can assist in development of meaningful community consultation activities.","health is a very prominent news category. however, we know little about the production processes of journalists leading to the health stories we encounter on a daily basis. such knowledge is crucial for ensuring a vibrant public sphere for health. this article draws on interviews with eight health journalists in new zealand to document what they consider to constitute a health story, their professional norms and practices, their perceptions of audiences, and the need for increased civic deliberations regarding health. journalists privilege biomedical stories involving lifestyle and individual responsibility, and have limited frames for presenting stories that involve socio-political concerns. stories are strongly shaped by journalists' considerations of their target audience, the sources they draw on, their professional norms, and institutional practices. this results in the omission of stories that have relevance for minority and disadvantaged groups and limits the nature of the stories told to ones that reflect the views of the majority. however, journalists are also reflective about these issues and receptive to ways to overcome them. this raises possibilities for health researchers to engage with journalists in order to repoliticise health and promote a more civic-oriented form of health journalism.","within the framework of the european concerted action on cystic fibrosis (biomed-2, bmh4-ct96-0462) a quality assessment was set up for 135 european and one australian laboratory. six dna samples were sent to the various laboratories. these samples carried the following cftr genotypes: df508/n1303k; di507/wild; df508/g551d; df508/621 + 1 gtot; r553x/wild and 1717-1 gtoa/wild. each laboratory was asked to process the samples as they routinely do, whether they checked for all mutations or not. more than 75% of the laboratories screened for at least six of these mutations. heteroduplex analysis was the most frequently used primary testing method (47%), in many instances followed by restriction enzyme digestion. only a minority of the laboratories made use of a commercial cftr mutation detection kit. on average, 91% of the laboratories correctly typed both alleles of a given dna sample. however, 35% of the laboratories incorrectly typed one or more alleles from a total of 12 alleles included in the trial. one laboratory even failed to identify four of the different alleles correctly. the genotyping error frequency tended to be lower in laboratories which perform more than 200 cftr mutation analyses per year. the results of this quality control trial suggest that there are many laboratories (35%) which have a percentage of errors unacceptable in a routine testing setting. the development of a consensus testing strategy for routine diagnostic laboratories and centralised mutation analysis facilities for rare or country-specific mutations in a limited number of expert centres, in combination with regular training sessions and quality assessments, should further improve genotyping.","basophils are evolutionarily conserved in many animal species, in spite of the fact that they account for &lt;1% of peripheral blood leukocyte. this suggests that basophils have an indispensable and nonredundant role in vivo, even though they show some phenotypic similarity with tissue-resident mast cells. however, their functional significance remained uncertain long after paul ehrlich discovered them as blood-circulating cells with basophilic granules more than 130 years ago. the study of basophils has been far behind that of mast cells, owing to the rarity of basophils and the paucity of tools for their detection and functional analysis. recent development of novel analytical tools, including basophil-depleting antibodies and genetically engineered mice deficient only in basophils, has greatly advanced basophil research and illuminated previously unrecognized roles of basophils. we now appreciate that basophils and mast cells play distinct roles in immune responses. basophils have crucial roles in the development of acute and chronic allergic responses, the protective immunity against ecto- and endoparasites, and the regulation of acquired immunity, including the augmentation of humoral memory responses and the initiation of th2 responses. thus, basophils are no longer the neglected minority and are key players in the immune system. 2011 john wiley &amp;

methods: we present a study of 56 acute ischemic stroke patients who were randomized in 4 trials (2 trials testing neuroprotective agents, 1 testing thrombolysis and 1 testing antithrombotic agents). a standardized questionnaire was used to assess the modalities of informed consent in this setting.; results: the mean age was 67.1 (sd 12.6) years. the mean baseline scandinavian stroke scale (sss) score was 23.8 (sd 10.5). only 13 patients (23% of cases) gave consent while relatives gave consent for 43 patients (77%). the main reason for not getting consent from the patient was aphasia in 29 patients (67.4%). multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the two independent factors influencing the ability to give consent are age and baseline neurological deficit as assessed by the sss score. concerning the psychological impact of consent, none of the 10 patients who answered our questionnaire declared feeling uncomfortable when giving consent, while 7 out of the 13 relatives who could be reached declared they felt uncomfortable, mainly because of the psychological stress induced by urgent decision making.; conclusions: our study emphasizes the specific ethical difficulties of informed consent in the setting of acute stroke research. only a minority of patients are able to give consent at the acute stage. increasing age and neurological deficit are independent predictors of inability to give consent. thus, the responsibility for consent usually relies on relatives with potential inaccuracy of decision concerning the patient's wish or even conflict of interest. further evaluation of the psychological impact of decision on relatives is needed in this setting of acute stroke. copyright (c) 2005 s. karger ag, basel.","background: the diffusion of health technologies from translational research to reimbursement depends on several factors included the results of health economic analysis. recent research identified several flaws in health economic concepts. additionally, the heterogeneous viewpoints of participating stakeholders are rarely systematically addressed in current decision-making. multi-criteria decision analysis (mcda) provides an opportunity to tackle these issues. the objective of this study was to review applications of mcda methods in decisions addressing the trade-off between costs and benefits.; methods: using basic steps of the prisma guidelines, a systematic review of the healthcare literature was performed to identify original research articles from january 1990 to april 2014. medline, pubmed, springer link and specific journals were searched. using predefined categories, bibliographic records were systematically extracted regarding the type of policy applications, mcda methodology, criteria used and their definitions.; results: 22 studies were included in the analysis. 15 studies (68 %) used direct mcda approaches and seven studies (32 %) used preference elicitation approaches. four studies (19 %) focused on technologies in the early innovation process. the majority (18 studies - 81 %) examined reimbursement decisions. decision criteria used in studies were obtained from the literature research and context-specific studies, expert opinions, and group discussions. the number of criteria ranged between three up to 15. the most frequently used criteria were health outcomes (73 %), disease impact (59 %), and implementation of the intervention (40 %). economic criteria included cost-effectiveness criteria (14 studies, 64 %), and total costs/budget impact of an intervention (eight studies, 36 %). the process of including economic aspects is very different among studies. some studies directly compare costs with other criteria while some include economic consideration in a second step.; conclusions: in early innovation processes, mcda can provide information about stakeholder preferences as well as evidence needs in further development. however, only a minority of these studies include economic features due to the limited evidence. the most important economic criterion cost-effectiveness should not be included from a technical perspective as it is already a composite of costs and benefit. there is a significant lack of consensus in methodology employed by the various studies which highlights the need for guidance on application of mcda at specific phases of an innovation.","objective: to examine the process and information used by medical directors (mds) of private health plans to make medical coverage determinations for new medical technologies, and to assess the influence of plan characteristics on the process.; design: cross-sectional national survey.; participants: two hundred thirty-one mds at private health plans representing 66% and 72% of the us population covered by hmos and indemnity plans, respectively.; measurements: actual and optimal review process, final decision authority, sources, and evidence used for technology coverage decisions.; results: in 96% of plans, mds take part in the medical policy review process for new technology. however, mds have final authority over coverage decisions in only 27% of plans. indemnity plans are more likely to assert that mds should be responsible for final decisions, odds ration (or) = 3.3 (95% confidence interval [95% ci] 1.4, 10). optimal sources of information of new technology were journals, medical society statements or practice guidelines, and opinions of national experts. actual sources of information used differed from optimal ones; local experts were used more often than is considered optimal (p &lt; .001). for-profit plans were more likely than nonprofit plans to use national experts, or 2.5 (95% ci 1.3, 5.0), and practice guidelines, or 5.0 (95% ci 2.5, 10). randomized trials (94% of mds) meta-analyses (61%), and reviews (42%) were considered the best evidence for making coverage decisions. barriers to making optimal decisions were lack of timely evidence on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, not legal or regulatory issues; hmo, small, and nonprofit plans were two or three times more likely to list lack of cost-effectiveness data than their counterparts (p &lt; .05).; conclusions: although mds are nearly always involved in the technology evaluation process, a minority of mds retain final authority over coverage decisions. evidence from strong scientific research designs is the most frequently cited basis for decisions, but there is need for more timely, rigorous scientific evidence on medical interventions. how a health plan evaluates a new medical technology for coverage varies with identifiable plan characteristics.","this report summarizes the findings and recommendations of an expert consensus workgroup that addressed the endangered pipeline of geriatric mental health (gmh) researchers. the workgroup was convened at the summit on challenges in recruitment, retention, and career development in geriatric mental health research in late 2007. major identified challenges included attracting and developing early-career investigators into the field of gmh research; a shortfall of geriatric clinical providers and researchers; a disproportionate lack of minority researchers; inadequate mentoring and career development resources; and the loss of promising researchers during the vulnerable period of transition from research training to independent research funding. the field of gmh research has been at the forefront of developing successful programs that address these issues while spanning the spectrum of research career development. these programs serve as a model for other fields and disciplines. core elements of these multicomponent programs include summer internships to foster early interest in gmh research (summer training on aging research topics-mental health program), research sponsorships aimed at recruitment into the field of geriatric psychiatry (stepping stones), research training institutes for early career development (summer research institute in geriatric psychiatry), mentored intensive programs on developing and obtaining a first research grant (advanced research institute in geriatric psychiatry), targeted development of minority researchers (institute for research minority training on mental health and aging), and a web-based clearinghouse of mentoring seminars and resources (mededmentoring.org). this report discusses implications of and principles for disseminating these programs, including examples of replications in fields besides gmh research.","we examined the range and nature of investigators' communication and relationship building as they recruit minority participants in their research. semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 33 investigators conducting research with human participants. the response rate was 77%. investigators described several kinds of relationships that are formed or called upon when including minority participants in research. the relationships ranged from study-related, short-term interactions geared solely to facilitate recruitment to others that were longer term, extending beyond a particular project. the data suggest that a range of relationships is important as investigators seek to include minority populations in research. these relationships can both facilitate the recruitment process as well as aid in the interpretation of research findings.","evidence is presented that suggests routine clinical practice is limited by therapist optimism about their personal effects on patients. this optimistic view prevents them from recognizing which of their patients are headed for a negative treatment outcome and taking steps to prevent poor outcomes for such cases. a formal method of measuring and monitoring patient treatment response that includes prediction of treatment failure is presented along with evidence that it more than doubles positive outcomes while substantially reducing deterioration. in addition, the collection of archival data helps therapists answer questions of interest to them, such as their own degree of effectiveness, and outcomes with minority clients, genders, and related clinical issues. psycinfo database record (c) 2012 apa, all rights reserved.","background: clinical practice guidelines (cpgs) shape clinical care worldwide but are prone to potential error and bias due to conflicts of interest (coi).; objective: to explore the extent and scope of american academy of neurology (aan) guideline author reported coi and implications for management; and to review process of aan guideline coi management to highlight challenges, establish comparative benchmarks, and identify areas to be improved.; methods: authors of aan clinical practice guidelines with an active membership panel completed a coi reporting form. authors were asked to report current interests including the 1 year prior to the date of completing the form. interests include personal income relationships (consulting, speaker's bureaus, advisory boards), equity (stocks/stock options), patent/royalties, research, clinical practice, fiduciary interest in a company, and expert testimony. comparisons were made between the two committees that oversee cpg development at the aan: the quality standards subcommittee (qss) and the therapeutics and technology assessment (tta) subcommittee.; results: there were 50 cpg with an average of 8.5 authors per cpg. there were a total of 425 available authors, 351 of whom completed a coi reporting form (83% response rate). forty-six of the 50 guidelines had at least one author with a coi. the most commonly reported cois were research-related (45% of authors), clinical practice-related (42%), and personal income relationships (33%). authors of qss guidelines were more likely to have personal income cois with pharmaceutical and medical device companies (39% vs 24%, p &lt; 0.01), whereas authors of tta guidelines were more likely to have clinical practice-related cois (50% vs 38%, p &lt; 0.05). a minority of authors had individual cois exceeding &gt;$25,000 or had multiple interests (&gt;10) that overlapped with content of the guidelines.; conclusion: conflicts of interest are common for authors of american academy of neurology clinical practice guidelines across many domains of personal and professional interests. more research is needed to improve the methods to identify and quantify the types of conflicts and their potential biasing effects on selecting guideline topics, grading research evidence, and formulating practice recommendations.","the increasing evidence that many addictive phenomena have a genetic and neurobiological basis promises improvements in societal responses to addiction that raise important ethical and social policy issues. one of the major potential benefits of such research is improved treatment of drug addiction, but in order to do the research required to realize this promise, it will be necessary to address ethical doubts raised about the capacity of addicted persons to give free and informed consent to participate in studies that involve the administration of drugs of dependence. neuroscience research on addiction promises to transform the long running debate between moral and medical models of addiction by providing a detailed causal explanation of addiction in terms of brain processes. we must avoid causal models of addiction being misinterpreted as supporting simple-minded social policies, e.g., that we identify the minority of the community that is genetically and biologically vulnerable to addiction and hence can neglect social policy options for reducing addiction, including drug control policies. causal accounts of addiction supplied by neuroscience and genetic research may also be seen to warrant the use of pharmacotherapies and drug vaccines under legal coercion. neuroscientists also need to anticipate the ethical issues that may arise if the knowledge that they produce delivers interventions that enhance human cognitive and other capacities. advances in neuroimaging that enable us to identify \"addicts\" or predict future risk of addiction will raise concerns about invasion of privacy, third-party use of neuroimaging data, the powers of courts to coerce defendants to undergo such tests, and consumer protection against the overinterpretation of test results. given the strong public and media interest in the results of their research, neuroscientists and geneticists have a moral obligation, and a professional interest, to minimize popular misunderstandings of their work in the media that may rebound to its detriment. copyright 2004 elsevier ltd.","purpose of review: this article reviews marketed pharmacologic treatments for alzheimer disease as well as their efficacy, effectiveness, adverse effects, and issues involved in their use, including duration of treatment, adverse events, and controversies. current experimental drug development, including challenges to developing successful drugs for alzheimer disease, are also reviewed and assessed.; recent findings: cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are the available pharmacologic treatment options. they show limited clinical effects over the shorter term for some patients, mild to moderate cholinergic adverse effects in a minority of patients, and potentially underappreciated toxicity over the longer term. no subsequent experimental drug in development has been successful thus far; there has not been a new drug marketed for alzheimer disease since 2003.; summary: cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are marketed for the treatment of alzheimer disease. drug development programs aimed at new targets, including the amyloid-beta cascade, have been unsuccessful thus far despite their designs to detect very small or minimal clinical effects from the experimental drugs. marked advances in preclinical science nevertheless support a basis for considerable optimism that effective interventions will be found soon.","background: despite the mandate to examine the medical, ethical, and economic implications of the development and use of health technology, health technology assessment (hta) reports often emphasize the epidemiologic and economic aspects, and omit ethical considerations. this study examines both whether and how ethical issues are incorporated into hta.; objectives: we aim to (i) review a set of canadian hta reports for ethics content, (ii) describe the strategies used to incorporate ethically relevant information into hta, and (iii) determine the presence of implicit ethical issues in a sample of hta reports.; methods: descriptive and qualitative content analysis of 608 hta reports produced by six canadian hta agencies from january 1997 to december 2006.; results: we found that (i) a minority (17 percent) of canadian hta reports addressed ethical issues, (ii) secondary research predominates while primary analysis is rare, (iii) implicit ethical issues are present in hta reports that do not purport to address ethics.; conclusions: canadian hta reports rarely explicitly, and then only superficially, address ethics, though implicit ethical issues abound.","the cancer prevention and control research network is a national network recently established to focus on developing new interventions and disseminating and translating proven interventions into practice to reduce cancer burden and disparities, especially among minority and medically underserved populations. jointly funded by the centers for disease control and prevention and the national cancer institute, the cancer prevention and control research network consists of sites administered through prevention research centers funded by the centers for disease control and prevention. the five sites are located in kentucky, massachusetts, south carolina, texas, washington state, and west virginia. the cancer prevention and control research network's intervention areas include primary prevention of cancer through healthy eating, physical activity, sun avoidance, tobacco control, and early detection of cancer through screening. the cancer prevention and control research network uses the methods of community-based participatory research and seeks to build on the cancer-relevant systematic reviews of the guide to community preventive services. initial foci for the cancer prevention and control research network's research work groups include projects to increase screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers; to promote informed decision making for prostate cancer screening; and to validate educational materials developed for low-literacy populations.","objectives: we sought to investigate whether, and if so, how published sham-controlled trials of acupuncture report on the information given to patients about true and sham interventions. we asked acupuncture therapists to provide original patient information leaflets in order to study how interventions were described in more detail.; methods: forty-seven (47) published sham-controlled trials of acupuncture collected for a systematic review on sham techniques were screened to determine whether they reported on information given to patients about study interventions; any such information was extracted. we contacted authors of published studies and other researchers in the field and asked them to provide copies of original patient information leaflets. information given to patients about true and sham interventions was extracted.; results: ten (10; 21%) of the 47 published studies included some information on how patients were informed. none of these studies appear to have used the term \"sham\" or \"placebo\" and most appear to have suggested that two types of acupuncture were compared. in the 16 original patient information leaflets obtained, the way patients were informed varied greatly: 7 leaflets explicitly included words such as \"sham,\" \"placebo,\" or \"dummy.\" others described the control intervention as not meeting all criteria of acupuncture. finally, one group of studies simply suggested that different types of acupuncture were being compared.; conclusion: our results indicate that (1) only a minority of published trials report on information given to patients about true and sham interventions and (2) that information strategies vary considerably and are often not fully explicit. this has not only ethical relevance but also might influence results of trials.","ingmar persson and julian savulescu argue that non-traditional forms of cognitive enhancement (those involving genetic engineering or pharmaceuticals) present a serious threat to humanity, since the fruits of such enhancement, accelerated scientific progress, will give the morally corrupt minority of humanity new and more effective ways to cause great harm. and yet it is scientific progress, accelerated by non-traditional cognitive enhancement, which could allow us to dramatically morally enhance human beings, thereby eliminating, or at least reducing, the threat from the morally corrupt minority. i argue that this apparently intractable dilemma is less difficult to resolve than persson and savulescu suppose. their analysis of non-traditional cognitive enhancement overstates the risks and undervalues the benefits that such enhancement might provide. once the benefits are better described, it is clear that non-traditional cognitive enhancement could be the means of our survival, not of our destruction.","objective: to describe the history and evolution of the collaborative depression care model and new research aimed at enhancing dissemination.; method: four keynote speakers from the 2009 nimh annual mental health services meeting collaborated in this article in order to describe the history and evolution of collaborative depression care, adaptation of collaborative care to new populations and medical settings, and optimal ways to enhance dissemination of this model.; results: extensive evidence across 37 randomized trials has shown the effectiveness of collaborative care vs. usual primary care in enhancing quality of depression care and in improving depressive outcomes for up to 2 to 5 years. collaborative care is currently being disseminated in large health care organizations such as the veterans administration and kaiser permanente, as well as in fee-for-services systems and federally funded clinic systems of care in multiple states. new adaptations of collaborative care are being tested in pediatric and ob-gyn populations as well as in populations of patients with multiple comorbid medical illnesses. new nimh-funded research is also testing community-based participatory research approaches to collaborative care to attempt to decrease disparities of care in underserved minority populations.; conclusion: collaborative depression care has extensive research supporting the effectiveness of this model. new research and demonstration projects have focused on adapting this model to new populations and medical settings and on studying ways to optimally disseminate this approach to care, including developing financial models to incentivize dissemination and partnerships with community populations to enhance sustainability and to decrease disparities in quality of mental health care. copyright 2010 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.","aims: the procurement and usage of tissue samples has begun receiving increasing legal and ethical attention. the authors' aim was to develop an empirically based understanding of public attitudes to the use of tissue for research.; method: a questionnaire was distributed to a randomized sample (n=1,000) of the population in the age group 18-85 in vasterbotten county, sweden.; results: the response rate was approximately 60%. there was a general acceptance of genetic research based on biobank material (71%) but, though it is often a prerequisite for tissue-based research, a majority (62%) would not allow researchers to examine their healthcare records without specific consent. a majority (66.8%) accepted surrogate decisions by research ethical committees; 48% of the respondents estimated that they would feel respected if they were notified each time a sample was used. when compared and ranked with other issues, informed consent was a principal concern to a minority (4%) only. should research efforts generate information on future health risks, a majority (55%) would want to be told only if treatment was available.; conclusion: though genetic research in bioethical debate is often viewed as a potential threat to the integrity of the donor, the confidentiality of medical records still seems to concern donors more. research ethical committees have support in the majority of the population for some surrogate decisions. the current emphasis on the question of informed consent in policy making for biobank-based research does not seem to be reflected unambiguously in the concerns of the general public.","the international breast cancer study group (ibcsg) has been conducting large, phase iii clinical trials since 1978. prior to 1986, these activities were carried out under the name of ludwig breast cancer study group. seven trials of adjuvant therapies are currently open for patient accrual, five of which are described in this report. the ibcsg has been a leader in the field of tailored treatment approaches for specific subpopulations of patients with breast cancer, believing that what is best for the majority may not be best for a defined minority.","the purpose of this study was to assess the degree of editorial independence at a sample of medical journals and the relationship between the journals and their owners. we surveyed the editors of 33 medical journals owned by not-for-profit organizations (\"associations\"), including 10 journals represented on the international committee of medical journal editors (nine of which are general medical journals) and a random sample of 23 specialist journals with high impact factors that are indexed by the institute for scientific information. the main outcome measures were the authority to hire, fire, and oversee the work of the editor; the editor's tenure and financial compensation; control of the journal's budget; publication of material about the association; and the editor's perceptions about editorial independence and pressure over editorial content. of the 33 editors, 23 (70%) reported having complete editorial freedom, and the remainder reported a high level of freedom (a score of &gt; or = 8, where 10 equals complete editorial freedom and 1 equals no editorial freedom). nevertheless, a substantial minority of editors reported having received at least some pressure in recent years over editorial content from the association's leadership (42%), senior staff (30%), or rank-and-file members (39%). the association's board of directors has the authority to hire (48%) or fire (55%) the editor for about half of the journals, and the editor reports to the board for 10 journals (30%). twenty-three editors (70%) are appointed for a specific term (median term = 5 years). three-fifths of the journals have no control over their profit, and the majority of journals use the association's legal counsel and/or media relations staff. stronger safeguards are needed to give editors protection against pressure over editorial content, including written guarantees of editorial freedom and governance structures that support those guarantees. strong safeguards are also needed because editors may have less freedom than they believe (especially if they have not yet tested their freedom in an area of controversy).","objective: the u.k. nhs economic evaluation database (eed) project is commissioned to identify papers on economic evaluations of health technologies and to disseminate their findings to nhs decision makers by means of structured abstracts that are available through a public database and the cochrane library. this paper discusses current issues relating to the economic aspects of producing nhs eed abstracts.; methods: a review of nhs eed was undertaken between 1994 and 1999 to determine the methodologies adopted and issues that influence the usefulness of economic evaluations. methods adopted to improve the quality of nhs eed abstracts are also reported.; results: eighty-five percent of nhs eed abstracts are cost-effectiveness analyses (ceas), 9.3% are cost-utility analyses (cuas), and only 1.4% are cost-benefit analyses (cbas). of the total abstracts, 65.9% are based on single studies, 19.5% on reviews, 3.9% on estimates of effectiveness, and 10.7% on combinations of these sources. models are utilized in 16.7% of ceas, 60.2% of cuas, and 20% of cbas. analyses of cba studies reveal a degree of misuse of well-established definitions. nhs eed internal control mechanisms are reported that provide a means of ensuring that abstracts are based on sound academic principles.; conclusions: most economic evaluations are conducted by means of cea, followed by cua, while cba accounts for an extreme minority of cases. single studies form the principal source of effectiveness data, although models are widely used, principally in cua. the structure of nhs eed abstracts provides decision makers with the principal results and an interpretation of the relative strengths and weaknesses of economic evaluations.","asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder canonically associated with type 2 airway inflammation as characterized by elevated levels of eosinophils, immunoglobulin e, and cytokines including interleukin (il) 4, il5, il9, and il13 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf) alpha. however, mounting evidence has shown that considerable heterogeneity exists in human asthma in terms of the nature and intensity of airway inflammation. while many asthma patients achieve acceptable control of symptoms with standard-of-care therapies such as beta-adrenergic agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, a minority remains symptomatic despite maximal standard-of-care therapy and constitutes a significant unmet medical need. a growing number of investigational therapeutics under clinical development for asthma are biologic therapies that specifically target mediators of type 2 airway inflammation. in this chapter, we consider the biological functions of therapeutic targets in asthma and data from clinical trials of biologic agents directed against these targets. we discuss recent clinical trial results in terms of four key components of drug development: target selection, molecule selection, outcome selection, and patient selection, with particular attention paid to the emerging role of biomarkers in clinical development for asthma. copyright 2013 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.","purpose: we wanted to obtain the viewpoints of a community advisory board in training junior minority faculty members and graduate students for community-based participatory research (cbpr) on mental health in primary care.; methods: during training institutes, members of a community advisory board presented plenary sessions on research collaboration with communities. the program director edited the transcribed recordings of the presentations for style but not for content. advisory board members collaborated in revising the transcripts and summarizing themes.; results: board members expressed several key themes. research must take into account traditional healing practices and prior exploitative research. historical trauma impedes collaborations, which require conflict resolution and departure from traditional definitions of normalcy. researchers should include communities in formulating research agendas and should take findings back to the communities for critical appraisal and practical applications. collaborations should address policy issues including interpreter services, medicaid managed care, and parity in insurance coverage for physical and mental health problems.; conclusions: community advisory board members present key concerns that otherwise would not enter into the researchers' training curriculum. such an advisory board can make important contributions to programs that seek to improve cbpr in mental health and primary care.","jager and leek have tried to estimate a false-discovery rate (fdr) in abstracts of articles published in five medical journals during 2000-2010. their approach is flawed in sampling, calculations, and conclusions. it uses a tiny portion of select papers in highly select journals. randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews (designs with the lowest anticipated false-positive rates) are 52% of the analyzed papers, while these designs account for only 4% in pubmed in the same period. the fdr calculations consider the entire published literature as equivalent to a single genomic experiment where all performed analyses are reported without selection or distortion. however, the data used are the p-values reported in the abstracts of published papers; these p-values are a highly distorted, highly select sample. besides selective reporting biases, all other biases, in particular confounding in observational studies, are also ignored, while these are often the main drivers for high false-positive rates in the biomedical literature. a reproducibility check of the raw data shows that much of the data jager and leek used are either wrong or make no sense: most of the usable data were missed by their script, 94% of the abstracts that reported 2 p-values had high correlation/overlap between reported outcomes, and only a minority of p-values corresponded to relevant primary outcomes. the jager and leek paper exemplifies the dreadful combination of using automated scripts with wrong methods and unreliable data. sadly, this combination is common in the medical literature.","aim: to determine the appropriateness of asking healthy children to make a decision regarding participation in a research study.; methods: participants constituted a group of children taking part in a follow-up to a vaccine study which involved a blood test to look at the persistence of antibodies. information about the study was given to each child and following venepuncture an oral questionnaire was completed to establish understanding of the vaccine study. parental views concerning their child's ability to make a decision regarding research participation were also sought.; results: 73 children participated overall. following venepuncture 59% (n = 43) had grasped some aspect of the reasoning behind venepuncture with 33% (n = 24) unclear. the majority of parents (n = 55) and a substantial number of children (n = 28) believed that the parent should make the decision about study participation, although it is clear that a significant minority of parents thought it is right to involve the child in that process.; conclusion: new guidance about the requirements for informed consent involving children in research is needed, which can respect the autonomy of the child and the role of the parent, while recognising the limited capacity of some children to understand age-appropriate information.","objective: to review the published literature assessing the efficacy and safety of mitomycin-c (mmc) as an adjunctive treatment in corneal surface excimer laser ablation procedures.; methods: literature searches of the pubmed and cochrane library databases were last conducted on august 19, 2014, without language or date limitations. the searches retrieved a total of 239 references. of these, members of the ophthalmic technology assessment committee refractive management/intervention panel selected 26 articles that were considered to be of high or medium clinical relevance, and the panel methodologist rated each article according to the strength of evidence. ten studies were rated as level i evidence, 5 studies were rated as level ii evidence, and the remaining 11 studies were rated as level iii evidence.; results: the majority of the articles surveyed in this report support the role of mmc as an adjunctive treatment in surface ablation procedures. when mmc is applied in the appropriate concentration and confined to the central cornea, the incidence of post-surface ablation haze is decreased. although a minority of studies that evaluated endothelial cell density (ecd) reported an mmc-related decrease in ecd, no clinical adverse outcomes were reported.; conclusions: over the past 15 years, the use of mmc during surgery in surface ablation has become widespread. there is good evidence of the effectiveness of mmc when used intraoperatively as prophylaxis against haze in higher myopic ablations. although there are reports of decreased endothelial counts after the administration of mmc during surgery, the clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain, because no adverse outcomes were reported with as much as 5 years of follow-up. optimal dosage, effectiveness as prophylaxis in lower myopic and hyperopic ablations, and long-term safety, particularly in eyes with reduced corneal endothelial cell counts from prior intraocular surgery, have yet to be established. copyright 2015 american academy of ophthalmology. published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.","objectives: to obtain further information from members of the international network of agencies for health technology assessment (inahta) on the involvement of consumers in their programs.; methods: a questionnaire for a survey was developed and sent to member agencies in november 2010. survey responses were compared with those from an earlier survey conducted in 2005.; results: of the thirty-three agencies that provided responses, 67 percent involve consumers in some aspects of their health technology assessment (hta) programs, compared with 57 percent in 2005. as in the earlier survey, most agencies reporting involvement have contact with consumer or patient organizations and a large minority also involve individual consumers. summaries of hta reports that are intended to be easily understood by consumers are prepared by 84 percent of the agencies, and 42 percent involve consumers in dissemination of hta material. in both areas, there was some increase from the levels previously reported.; conclusions: the survey results suggest that there is a trend to increased involvement of consumers by the inahta agencies in their programs but that the level of involvement remains relatively limited. the manner of consumer participation varies between agencies.","objective: to describe the process and outcomes of local institutional review board (irb) review for 2 pediatric research in office settings (pros) studies.; design: pediatric research in office settings conducted 2 national studies concerning sensitive topics: (1) child abuse recognition experience study (cares), an observational study of physician decision making, and (2) safety check, a violence prevention intervention trial. institutional review board approval was secured by investigators' sites, the american academy of pediatrics, and practices with local irbs. practices were queried about irb rules at pros enrollment and study recruitment.; setting: pediatric research in office settings practices in 29 states.; participants: eighty-eight pros practices (75 irbs). main exposure local irb presence.; main outcome measures: local irb presence, level of pros assistance, irb process, study participation, data collection completion, and minority enrollment.; results: practices requiring additional local irb approval agreed to participate less than those that did not (cares: 33% vs 52%; safety check: 41% vs 56%). of the 88 practices requiring local irb approval, 55 received approval, with nearly 50% needing active pros help, many requiring consent changes (eg, contact name additions, local irb approval stamps), and 87% beginning data collection. median days to obtain approval were 81 (cares) and 109 (safety check). practices requiring local irb approval were less likely to complete data collection but more likely to enroll minority patients.; conclusions: local irb review was associated with lower participation rates, substantial effort navigating the process (with approval universally granted without substantive changes), and data collection delays. when considering future reforms, the national human subject protections system should consider the potential redundancy and effect on generalizability, particularly regarding enrollment of poor urban children, related to local irb review.","rationale and objectives: the availability of anonymized data is a keystone of medical research, yet little is known about lay views towards the process of anonymization or on the way that anonymized medical data are transferred to researchers.; methods: during may and june 2009, as part of a wider consultation on methods for releasing data to researchers, three focus groups (n = 19) were conducted exploring lay attitudes towards the traditional 'warehouse' model commonly used in medical research for delivering anonymized national health service (nhs) data to researchers. the focus groups explored different processes such as the copying of data, use of programmers for linkage and anonymization, the transfer of data and governance.; results: the recognition of the positive aspects of medical research and desire to support it formed the context for discussions. nonetheless, individuals varied in their attitudes to the use of anonymized data extracts for research from their health records (without consent); although some appeared positive wanted to be asked to consent for this use. furthermore, participants were acutely aware of security breaches of nhs information nevertheless, they continued to display a high level of trust in nhs staff. participants were concerned about the practicalities of the warehouse model and relied on their own life experiences to make sense of the model (using analogies with 'banks' or 'libraries'). the general attitude towards the processes underlying the warehouse model might best be captured by the term 'ambivalence'.; conclusions: this research (1) offers unique insights into views of anonymization of health data extracts, how it is undertaken and data are transferred and (2) adds to an increasing body of work that demonstrates that a minority of individuals are concerned about consent, even when data are anonymized although (3) those concerned about anonymization do not necessarily seek resolution through gaining consent. 2010 blackwell publishing ltd.","aims: there is still debate as to whether the addition of interpretative comments to laboratory reports can influence the management of patients. little is known about the extent of this activity in individual laboratories throughout the uk and so this national survey aimed to establish the prevalence.; methods: an electronic questionnaire was sent to 196 nhs laboratories in the uk asking whether 17 commonly requested groups of tests were reported with interpretative comments and, if so, how laboratory computers and/or humans were involved in the process. enquiries were also made of the grades of staff performing the process and of any 'vignette' examples where interpretative reporting had improved the clinical outcome for the patient.; results: a total of 138 of the 196 laboratories (70%) responded. only two laboratories did not have staff adding interpretative comments to any of the 17 tests. consultant laboratory staff reporting predominated in all tests with a significant minority also being added by biomedical scientists. high-volume requests usually had staff adding comments to results selected by computer rules whereas more of the specialist endocrine tests tended to be considered for comment. only six of 71 vignettes referred specifically to 'routine' biochemistry.; conclusions: the addition of interpretative comments onto clinical biochemistry reports is widespread throughout the uk. this service is largely consultant led. there is anecdotal evidence that the process can influence the clinical management of patients.","in an era of significant biomedical advances in the treatment of hiv, health disparities still persist. the participation of minority researchers brings new perspectives to health-disparities research. mentoring is key to this process. we present the multifaceted mentoring model that evolved in the puerto rico comprehensive center for the study of hiv disparities and the mentoring institute for hiv and mental health. the model includes (1) multi-institutional collaborations, (2) competency development, and (3) cross-disciplinary teams. these aspects of the model provide guidelines for institutions seeking to formalize mentoring programs while addressing the complexities of health disparities. the competency development component is a powerful tool in assessing and supporting the researchers. further explorations on the applicability of the model are encouraged.","ethnopharmacological relevance: the present conceptual review explores intercultural healthcare--defined as the integration of traditional medicine and biomedicine as complementary healthcare systems--in minority and underserved communities. this integration can take place at different levels: individuals (patients, healers, biomedical healthcare providers), institutions (health centers, hospitals) or society (government policy).; background: contemporary ethnobotany research of traditional medicine has primarily dealt with the botanical identification of plants commonly used by local communities, and the identification of health conditions treated with these plants, whereas ethnopharmacology has focused on the bioactivity of traditional remedies. on the other hand, medical anthropology seems to be the scholarship more involved with research into patients' healthcare-seeking itineraries and their interaction with traditional versus biomedical healthcare systems. the direct impact of these studies on public health of local communities can be contested.; aim of the review: to compare and discuss the body of scholarly work that deals with different aspects of traditional medicine in underserved and minority communities, and to reflect on how gaps identified in research can be bridged to help improve healthcare in these communities.; key findings: the literature covers a broad range of information of relevance to intercultural healthcare. this information is fragmented across different scientific and clinical disciplines. a conceptual review of these studies identifies a clear need to devote more attention to ways in which research on traditional medicine can be more effectively applied to improve local public health in biomedical resource-poor settings, or in geographic areas that have disparities in access to healthcare.; conclusions: scholars studying traditional medicine should prioritize a more interdisciplinary and applied perspective to their work in order to forge a more direct social impact on public health in local communities most in need of healthcare. copyright 2013 elsevier ireland ltd. all rights reserved.","this study aimed to ascertain the value of posters at medical meetings to presenters and delegates. the usefulness of posters to presenters at national and international meetings was evaluated by assessing the numbers of delegates visiting them and the reasons why they visited. memorability of selected posters was assessed and factors influencing their appeal to expert delegates identified. at both the national and international meetings, very few delegates (&lt; 5%) visited posters. only a minority read them and fewer asked useful questions. recall of content was so poor that it prevented identification of factors improving their memorability. factors increasing posters' visual appeal included their scientific content, pictures/graphs and limited use of words. few delegates visit posters and those doing so recall little of their content. to engage their audience, researchers should design visually appealing posters by presenting high quality data in pictures or graphs without an excess of words.","with regard to cancer management, minority populations do not fare as well as the majority in the u.s. health-care system. there is clear evidence of an increased incidence of cancer in minority populations, in many cases accompanied by reduced survival. several factors appear to contribute to these differences, and the biomedical community has begun to focus on definining the scope of the problem and possible solutions. this review will address specific areas of disparity in cancer care, including prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes, and will consider steps toward resolving these issues.","dialogue in the medical and public health communities has increasingly focused attention in the area of health disparities. we believe that the elimination of health disparities in the united states will require a multipronged approach that includes, at the very least, new approaches in both biomedical and prevention interventions. we also believe that since health disparities primarily affect communities of color, a model which fosters the development of junior scientists, clinicians and researchers of color who serve these communities will yield important progress in this field. the minority hiv/aids research initiative at the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) is a program that, through targeted research, aims to address health disparities in hiv/aids. although the program is disease specific, there are a variety of lessons learned from its inception and implementation that can be useful throughout the scientific, medical and public health communities.","background: identifying literature for a systematic review requires searching a variety of sources. the main sources are typically bibliographic databases. web searching using search engines and websites may be used to identify grey literature. searches should be reported in order to ensure transparency and reproducibility. this study assesses the reporting of web searching for systematic reviews carried out by the national institute for health research (nihr) health technology assessment (hta) programme (uk). the study also makes recommendations about reporting web searching for systematic reviews in order to achieve a reasonable level of transparency and reproducibility.; methods: systematic reviews were identified by searching the hta database via the centre for reviews and dissemination (crd) website. systematic reviews were included in the study if they made reference to searching the web using either search engines or websites. a data-extraction checklist was designed to record how web searching was reported. the checklist recorded whether a systematic review reported: the names of search engines or websites; the dates they were searched; the search terms; the results of the searches; and, in the case of websites, whether a url was reported.; results: 554 hta reports published between january 2004 and december 2013 were identified. 300 of these reports are systematic reviews, of which 108 report web searching using either a search engine or a website. overall, the systematic reviews assessed in the study exhibit a low standard of web search reporting. in the majority of cases, the only details reported are the names of websites (n=54) or search engines (n=33). a small minority (n=6) exhibit the highest standard of web search reporting.; conclusions: most web search reporting in systematic reviews carried out on the uk hta programme is not detailed enough to ensure transparency and reproducibility. transparency of reporting could be improved by adhering to a reporting standard such as the standard detailed in the crd systematic reviews methods guidance. reproducibility is harder to achieve due to the frequency of changes to websites and search engines.","purpose of review: in this review, we briefly summarize three fruitful, emerging areas in liver transplantation research, quality of life; risk assessment; and patient safety. our goal is to highlight recent findings in these areas, with a call for increased integration of social scientists and transplant clinicians to address how best to shape policy and improve outcomes.; recent findings: after liver transplantation, recipients generally experience clinically significant, sustained improvement in their physical, social and emotional well being. however, a sizeable minority of patients do experience excess morbidity that may benefit from ongoing surveillance and/or intervention. there is growing body of research that describes risks associated with liver transplantation, which can be useful aids to better inform decision making by patients, clinicians, payers, and policy makers. in contrast, there has been a relative lack of empirical data on transplant patient safety vulnerabilities, placing the field of surgery in stark contrast to other high-risk industries, wherein such assessments inform continuous process improvement.; summary: health services and outcomes research has grown in importance in the liver transplantation literature, but several important questions remain unanswered that merit programmatic, interdisciplinary research.","the purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore whether the way mental health is conceptualized by older iranian immigrants can influence their mental health-related practices. in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 iranians who had immigrated to the united states after the age of 50. the findings from this study revealed that the older iranian immigrants were reluctant to seek mental health care services in the united states.this resistance was largely attributed to the cultural differences in mental health conceptualization (language, definitions, and terminology) and lack of trust in the effectiveness ofpsychotropic medications. the findings of this study have implications for health and social service professionals who provide services to older immigrants, refugees, and minority populations whose mental health conceptualization may not be consistent with the biomedical model.","background: data from scientific literature show that about 63% of abstracts presented at biomedical conferences will be published in full. some studies have indicated that full publication is associated with the direction of results (publication bias). no study has looked into the occurrence of publication bias in the field of addiction.; objectives: to investigate whether the significance or direction of results of abstracts presented at the major international scientific conference on addiction is associated with full publication; methods: the conference proceedings of the us annual meeting of the college on problems of drug dependence (cpdd), were handsearched for abstracts of randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that evaluated interventions for prevention, rehabilitation and treatment of drug addiction in humans (years searched 1993-2002). data regarding the study designs and outcomes reported were extracted. subsequent publication in peer reviewed journals was searched in medline and embase databases, as of march 2006.; results: out of 5919 abstracts presented, 581 met the inclusion criteria; 359 (62%) conference abstracts had been published in a broad variety of peer reviewed journals (average time of publication 2.6 years, sd +/- 1.78). the proportion of published studies was almost the same for randomized controlled trials (62.4%) and controlled clinical trials (59.5%) while studies that reported positive results were significantly more likely to be published (74.5%) than those that did not report statistical results (60.9%.), negative or null results (47.1%) and no results (38.6%), abstracts reporting positive results had a significantly higher probability of being published in full, while abstracts reporting null or negative results were half as likely to be published compared with positive ones (hr = 0.48; 95%ci 0.30-0.74); conclusion: clinical trials were the minority of abstracts presented at the cpdd; we found evidence of possible publication bias in the field of addiction, with negative or null results having half the likelihood of being published than positive ones.","objectives: to investigate attitudes to clinical research amongst cancer trial participants and nonparticipants, and to compare results with those from previous studies amongst participants in noncancer trials.; design: trial participating respondents were given three questionnaires during the clinical trials. respondents amongst patients declining randomization answered a single questionnaire.; setting: participants and nonparticipants in randomized clinical cancer trials.; subjects: forty-one participants and 47 nonparticipants in cancer trials.; results: altruistic motives of physicians to conduct medical research were highly rated. attitudes towards clinical research were positive in all groups, with nonparticipant respondents being the least positive. eight to nine tenths found scientific testing necessary before general health service implementation. trial participants were, as compared with nonparticipating respondents, more positive towards both participation of self and others. both personal and altruistic motives for participation were highly rated. primary reasons for nonparticipation were fear of 'the unknown' and/or unease with randomization. only a minority felt a moral problem created by declining trial participation. respondents amongst noncancer participants were more satisfied with the information given than both cancer participants and cancer nonparticipants. negative experiences in cancer participants generally dealt with frustration related to seeing too many physicians at check-up appointments.; conclusion: attitudes towards clinical research are generally positive even in cancer nonparticipants. both personal and altruistic motives for participation were highly rated. a fear of 'the unknown' and resentments towards randomization were primary reasons to renounce participation. seeing too many physicians at check-up appointments seems to be an important factor for negative experiences in cancer trial participants.","background: gene expression arrays are valuable and widely used tools for biomedical research. today's commercial arrays attempt to measure the expression level of all of the genes in the genome. effectively translating the results from the microarray into a biological interpretation requires an accurate mapping between the probesets on the array and the genes that they are targeting. although major array manufacturers provide annotations of their gene expression arrays, the methods used by various manufacturers are different and the annotations are difficult to keep up to date in the rapidly changing world of biological sequence databases.; results: we have created a consistent microarray annotation protocol applicable to all of the major array manufacturers. we constantly keep our annotations updated with the latest ensembl gene predictions, and thus cross-referenced with a large number of external biomedical sequence database identifiers. we show that these annotations are accurate and address in detail reasons for the minority of probesets that cannot be annotated. annotations are publicly accessible through the ensembl genome browser and programmatically through the ensembl application programming interface. they are also seamlessly integrated into the biomart data-mining tool and the biomart package of bioconductor.; conclusions: consistent, accurate and updated gene expression array annotations remain critical for biological research. our annotations facilitate accurate biological interpretation of gene expression profiles.","the sixth \"melanoma bridge meeting\" took place in naples, italy, december 1st-4th, 2015. the four sessions at this meeting were focused on: (1) molecular and immune advances; (2) combination therapies; (3) news in immunotherapy; and 4) tumor microenvironment and biomarkers. recent advances in tumor biology and immunology has led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic agents that prolong progression-free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) of cancer patients. immunotherapies in particular have emerged as highly successful approaches to treat patients with cancer including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), renal cell carcinoma (rcc), bladder cancer, and hodgkin's disease. specifically, many clinical successes have been using checkpoint receptor blockade, including t cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (ctla-4) and the programmed cell death-1 (pd-1) and its ligand pd-l1. despite demonstrated successes, responses to immunotherapy interventions occur only in a minority of patients. attempts are being made to improve responses to immunotherapy by developing biomarkers. optimizing biomarkers for immunotherapy could help properly select patients for treatment and help to monitor response, progression and resistance that are critical challenges for the immuno-oncology (io) field. importantly, biomarkers could help to design rational combination therapies. in addition, biomarkers may help to define mechanism of action of different agents, dose selection and to sequence drug combinations. however, biomarkers and assays development to guide cancer immunotherapy is highly challenging for several reasons: (i) multiplicity of immunotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action including immunotherapies that target activating and inhibitory t cell receptors (e.g., ctla-4, pd-1, etc.); adoptive t cell therapies that include tissue infiltrating lymphocytes (tils), chimeric antigen receptors (cars), and t cell receptor (tcr) modified t cells; (ii) tumor heterogeneity including changes in antigenic profiles over time and location in individual patient; and (iii) a variety of immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (tme) including t regulatory cells (treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (mdsc) and immunosuppressive cytokines. in addition, complex interaction of tumor-immune system further increases the level of difficulties in the process of biomarkers development and their validation for clinical use. recent clinical trial results have highlighted the potential for combination therapies that include immunomodulating agents such as anti-pd-1 and anti-ctla-4. agents targeting other immune inhibitory (e.g., tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., cd137) receptors on t cells and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer are tested for clinical efficacy in melanoma as well. these agents are also being tested in combination with targeted therapies to improve upon shorter-term responses thus far seen with targeted therapy. various locoregional interventions that demonstrate promising results in treatment of advanced melanoma are also integrated with immunotherapy agents and the combinations with cytotoxic chemotherapy and inhibitors of angiogenesis are changing the evolving landscape of therapeutic options and are being evaluated to prevent or delay resistance and to further improve survival rates for melanoma patients' population. this meeting's specific focus was on advances in immunotherapy and combination therapy for melanoma. the importance of understanding of melanoma genomic background for development of novel therapies and biomarkers for clinical application to predict the treatment response was an integral part of the meeting. the overall emphasis on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward integrating biomarkers into personalized-medicine approach for treatment of patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. translation of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across different tumors represents a bridge to impact on prognosis and response to therapy in melanoma. we also discussed the requirements for pre-analytical and analytical as well as clinical validation process as applied to biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. the concept of the fit-for-purpose marker validation has been introduced to address the challenges and strategies for analytical and clinical validation design for specific assays.","purpose: research using banked tissue is key to advancing risk-stratification and treatment of children with cancer. knowledge of parental attitudes to ethical issues arising in tissue banking is very limited but essential in obtaining respectful consent.; methods: one hundred parents of consecutively diagnosed children with cancer were offered a validated 34-item questionnaire.; results: respondents (n = 54) included 10 of 16 parents of deceased children. the majority (89%; n = 48) would agree to have tissue sent anywhere in the world but prefer pediatric aims (69%). most (98%; n = 53) would permit genetic research, if it might improve the child's health, and 76% (n = 41) would permit it, even if no impact was anticipated. a minority (41%) would not allow painful, strictly research procedures, while 15% would regardless of the child's dissent. just over half (54%; n = 29) wish to renew consent if stored tissue is used for another purpose. most (98%) believe their child should confirm consent by the age of majority, but only 71% believe the mature child should be able to withdraw consent. a minority (n = 40; 74%) claim few or no rights to research profits; 83% believe these should be used to fund childhood cancer research.; conclusions: parents are very supportive of tissue research, including genetic research. a majority of parents would prefer restricting research to pediatric conditions, and to be informed of results, even if of uncertain significance. these findings may assist institutional review boards in assessing parentally perceived risks of research, and researchers in providing consent elements that support parents and adolescents in making fully informed choices. copyright 2011 wiley periodicals, inc.","the unequal burden of cancer in minority and underserved communities nationally and in maryland is a compelling crisis. the maryland special populations cancer research network (mspn) developed an infrastructure covering maryland's 23 jurisdictions and baltimore city through formal partnerships between the university of maryland school of medicine, university of maryland statewide health network, university of maryland eastern shore, and community partners in baltimore city, rural eastern shore, rural western maryland, rural southern maryland, and piscataway conoy tribe and statewide american indians. guided by the community-based participatory framework, the mspn undertook a comprehensive assessment (of needs, strengths, and resources available) that laid the foundation for programmatic efforts in community-initiated cancer awareness and education, research, and training. the mspn infrastructure was used to implement successful and innovative community-based cancer education interventions and technological solutions; conduct education and promotion of clinical trials, cancer health disparities research, and minority faculty cancer research career development; and leverage additional resources for sustainability. mspn engaged in informed advocacy among decision- and policymakers at state and national levels, and its community-based clinical trials program was recognized by the u.s. department of health and human services as a best practice award. the solutions to reduce and eliminate cancer health disparities are complex and require comprehensive and focused multidisciplinary cancer health disparities research, training, and education strategies implemented through robust community-academic partnerships. cancer 2006.

summary: targeted therapy against epidermal growth factor receptor has become one of the primary focuses of the genitourinary spore in bladder cancer. the spore grant scheme is designed to encourage rapid development of new and innovative cancer research in areas of high priority, in this case bladder cancer. the spore has facilitated the advancement of novel epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy, such as the monoclonal antibody imc-225 and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor zd1839 (iressa), from the laboratory to clinical trials. the integration of these new biological agents in combination with chemotherapy, in order to abrogate the progression of advanced bladder cancer, is the prime directive of our current phase ii iressa/docetaxel trial.","background: biomedical research focuses on highly controlled clinical trials in academic health centers, where the emphasis is on disease treatment and rehabilitation. the results, therefore, are not readily applicable to patient populations that primary care clinicians encounter in their community practices, where the focus is on health promotion and disease prevention. although the number of practice-based research networks (pbrns) is growing in primary care, these networks are governed by the physicians who created them and address research questions reflective of physicians' practices and perspectives. other primary care clinicians, such as advanced practice registered nurses (aprns), who routinely provide care for underserved and minority populations lack a forum for studying their practice problems and processes. a pbrn of aprns in primary care provides a means for this research.; summary: the advanced practice registered nurses' research network in southern new england is the first pbrn established for aprns. this article describes the development of the network.","background: recent articles in the scientific literature have expressed concerns about financial conflicts of interest in the profession of medicine in general and the specialty of plastic surgery in particular. disclosure of financial ties to industry has been regarded as an address of a possible bias. the policies of medical journals places responsibility on authors for self-reporting of financial conflicts of interest, yet underreporting of conflicts of interest has occurred. the investigative hypothesis was that authors in the plastic surgery literature, in particular, plastic and reconstructive surgery, underreported financial conflicts of interest.; methods: a review of articles published in plastic and reconstructive surgery from july of 2015 through april of 2016 for author disclosures was accomplished. the disclosure statements were compared to the information available in the open payments database for 2015. the lack of disclosure on the part of an author, when present, was individually examined for relevance of the corporate conflicts of interest to the subject matter of the involved article.; results: a total of 302 articles authored by 1262 individuals were reviewed. one hundred thirty-nine (45.5 percent) had neither a disclosed nor an actual conflict of interest. in 61 articles (20.2 percent), one or more authors disclosed; 105 articles (34.8 percent) did not provide disclosure of a financial conflict of interest. in assessment of relevance, 10 undisclosed conflicts of interest (9.5 percent) were determined relevant, and one-third of that total were non-plastic surgeons.; conclusion: nondisclosure of financial conflicts of interest is common, but only a small minority pose a potential for harm from bias.","familial clustering is seen in 10% of gastric cancer cases and approximately 1-3% of gastric cancer arises in the setting of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc). in families with hdgc, gastric cancer presents at young age. hdgc is predominantly caused by germline mutations in cdh1 and in a minority by mutations in other genes, including ctnna1. early stage hdgc is characterized by a few, up to dozens of intramucosal foci of signet ring cell carcinoma and its precursor lesions. these include in situ signet ring cell carcinoma and pagetoid spread of signet ring cells. advanced hdgc presents as poorly cohesive/diffuse type carcinoma, normally with very few typical signet ring cells, and has a poor prognosis. currently, it is unknown which factors drive the progression towards aggressive disease, but it is clear that most intramucosal lesions will not have such progression.immunohistochemical profile of early and advanced hdgc is often characterized by abnormal e-cadherin immunoexpression, including absent or reduced membranous expression, as well as \"dotted\" or cytoplasmic expression. however, membranous expression of e-cadherin does not exclude hdgc. intramucosal hdgc (pt1a) presents with an \"indolent\" phenotype, characterized by typical signet ring cells without immunoexpression of ki-67 and p53, while advanced carcinomas (pt&gt;1) display an \"aggressive\" phenotype with pleomorphic cells, that are immunoreactive for ki-67 and p53. these features show that the ihc profile is different between intramucosal and more advanced hdgc, providing evidence of phenotypic heterogeneity, and may help to define predictive biomarkers of progression from indolent to aggressive, widely invasive carcinomas.","background: the amount of research utilizing health information has increased dramatically over the last ten years. many institutions have extensive biobank holdings collected over a number of years for clinical and teaching purposes, but are uncertain as to the proper circumstances in which to permit research uses of these samples. research ethics boards (rebs) in canada and elsewhere in the world are grappling with these issues, but lack clear guidance regarding their role in the creation of and access to registries and biobanks.; methods: chairs of 34 rebs and/or reb administrators affiliated with faculties of medicine in canadian universities were interviewed. interviews consisted of structured questions dealing with diabetes-related scenarios, with open-ended responses and probing for rationales. the two scenarios involved the development of a diabetes registry using clinical encounter data across several physicians' practices, and the addition of biological samples to the registry to create a biobank.; results: there was a wide range of responses given for the questions raised in the scenarios, indicating a lack of clarity about the role of rebs in registries and biobanks. with respect to the creation of a registry, a minority of sites felt that consent was not required for the information to be entered into the registry. whether patient consent was required for information to be entered into the registry and the duration for which the consent would be operative differed across sites. with respect to the creation of a biobank linked to the registry, a majority of sites viewed biobank information as qualitatively different from other types of personal health information. all respondents agreed that patient consent was needed for blood samples to be placed in the biobank but the duration of consent again varied.; conclusion: participants were more attuned to issues surrounding biobanks as compared to registries and demonstrated a higher level of concern regarding biobanks. as registries and biobanks expand, there is a need for critical analysis of suitable roles for rebs and subsequent guidance on these topics. the authors conclude by recommending reb participation in the creation of registries and biobanks and the eventual drafting of comprehensive legislation.","designing and implementing effective lifestyle modification strategies remains one of the great challenges in diabetes care. historically, programs have focused on individual behavior change with little or no attempt to integrate change within the broader social framework or community context. however, these contextual factors have been shown to be associated with poor diabetes outcomes, particularly in low-income minority populations. recent evidence suggests that one way to address these disparities is to match patient needs to existing community resources. not only does this position patients to more quickly adapt behavior in a practical way, but this also refers patients back to their local communities where a support mechanism is in place to sustain healthy behavior. technology offers a new and promising platform for connecting patients to meaningful resources (also referred to as \"assets\"). this paper summarizes several noteworthy innovations that use technology as a practical bridge between healthcare and community-based resources that promote diabetes self-care.","in a series of recent works, julian savulescu and ingmar persson insist that, given the ease by which irreversible destruction is achievable by a morally wicked minority, (i) strictly cognitive bio-enhancement is currently too risky, while (ii) moral bio-enhancement is plausibly morally mandatory (and urgently so). this article aims to show that the proposal savulescu and persson advance relies on several problematic assumptions about the separability of cognitive and moral enhancement as distinct aims. specifically, we propose that the underpinnings of savulescu's and persson's normative argument unravel once it is suitably clear how aiming to cognitively enhance an individual will in part require that one aim to bring about certain moral goods we show to be essential to cognitive flourishing; conversely, aiming to bring about moral enhancement in an individual must involve aiming to improve certain cognitive capacities we show to be essential to moral flourishing. after developing these points in some detail, and their implication for savulescu's &amp; persson's proposal, we conclude by outlining some positive suggestions. 2013 john wiley &amp; sons ltd.","health disparities are an immense challenge to american society. clinical and translational science awards (ctsas) housed within the national center for advancing translational science (ncats) are designed to accelerate the translation of experimental findings into clinically meaningful practices and bring new therapies to the doorsteps of all patients. research centers at minority institutions (rcmi) program at the national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd) are designed to build capacity for biomedical research and training at minority serving institutions. the ctsa created a mechanism fostering formal collaborations between research intensive universities and minority serving institutions (msi) supported by the rcmi program. these consortium-level collaborations activate unique translational research approaches to reduce health disparities with credence to each academic institutions history and unique characteristics. five formal partnerships between research intensive universities and msi have formed as a result of the ctsa and rcmi programs. these partnerships present a multifocal approach; shifting cultural change and consciousness toward addressing health disparities, and training the next generation of minority scientists. this collaborative model is based on the respective strengths and contributions of the partnering institutions, allowing bidirectional interchange and leveraging nih and institutional investments providing measurable benchmarks toward the elimination of health disparities. 2013 wiley periodicals, inc.","classification algorithms with unbalanced datasets tend to produce high predictive accuracy over the majority class, but poor predictive accuracy over the minority class. this problem is very common in biomedical data mining. this paper introduces a support vector machine (svm)-based optimized feature selection method, to select the most relevant features and maintain an accurate and well-balanced sensitivity-specificity result between unbalanced groups. a new metric called the balance index (b) is defined to implement this optimization. the balance index measures the difference between the misclassified data within each class. the proposed optimized feature selection is applied to the classification of patients' weaning trials from mechanical ventilation: patients with successful trials who were able to maintain spontaneous breathing after 48 h and patients who failed to maintain spontaneous breathing and were reconnected to mechanical ventilation after 30 min. patients are characterized through cardiac and respiratory signals, applying joint symbolic dynamic (jsd) analysis to cardiac interbeat and breath durations. first, the most suitable parameters (c+,c-,sigma) are selected to define the appropriate svm. then, the feature selection process is carried out with this svm, to maintain b lower than 40%. the best result is obtained using 6 features with an accuracy of 80%, a b of 18.64%, a sensitivity of 74.36% and a specificity of 82.42%. copyright 2013 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.","context: previously, in a low-income country with limited resources like pakistan, biomedical research was conducted mostly by individuals working in private organizations. recently, there has been an upsurge in the number of medical students conducting research in both private and public medical colleges of karachi, pakistan. we investigated student perceptions of the reasons behind the increase in biomedical research among medical students of private and public medical colleges in karachi, pakistan.; methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted at four medical universities of karachi, using structured data collection tool. participants included medical students who stated that they were interested in medical research. we assessed how many had been involved in research or stated that they intended to be, and tallied students' stated reasons why they were involved in research. chi-square analyses were used to assess if year of training, institution, and other factors were associated with the likelihood of past or current actual research involvement.; results: out of the 398 students with research interest who participated in the study, 349 (88%) stated that they intended to do research projects in their undergraduate years. at the time of the study, only 202 (51%) reported that they had actually conducted research. the reasons given for engaging in research for a minority included personal interest (n = 136; 34%), while majority stated that their motivation was to improve their curriculum vitae (75%) and/or to be more competitive for a residency in the united states (43%). the reasons students gave for involvement in research were related to whether their schools were public versus private and to their year of study.; discussion: according to students' reports, improving one's curriculum vitae to get a strong residency in the usa appeared to be a principal reason for the increase in biomedical research in karachi. the challenges of research, such as lack of good mentors and increased work-load were reported to affect few students' ability to engage in research.","major government efforts to widen the use of health information technology and speed the translation of biomedical research discoveries into clinical practice are converging with the rapid growth of the internet to create unprecedented opportunities to use telehealth networks to broaden access to high-quality healthcare and expand the scope and reach of clinical and translational research. recognizing the dual potential of telehealth networks to improve health outcomes and reduce barriers to participation in research, particularly in medically underserved communities, the national center for research resources (ncrr), part of the national institutes of health (nih), convened a national conference at the nih on june 25-26, 2009, titled \"future of telehealth: essential tools and technologies for clinical research and care,\" in collaboration with experts from the health resources and services administration, the indian health service, the department of veterans affairs, internet2, and the nih national library of medicine, national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering, and national center for minority health and health disparities. the conference brought together over 400 subject matter experts from government, academia, and industry to discuss a wide range of issues in telehealth research and development. its primary outcome is a set of short papers reporting on recommendations from thematic breakout sessions and some overarching recommendations that can, taken together, stimulate and help guide further research through new multi-agency, interdisciplinary collaborations.","to facilitate discussion, this paper describes various types of collections of specimens, their uses in research, types of identifiers, requirements for informed consent, third-party access to samples, recontact, and controversial ethical and social issues. there is need for public opinion research on people's views of these issues, with particular attention to the views of minority groups.","with passage and implementation of the affordable health care act, more vulnerable segments of the u.s. population will now have access to regular health care and increased opportunities to participate in biomedical research. yet, access to new groups brings with it new responsibilities for investigators, most importantly, reducing burdens for participants. data collected through this small pilot study suggest several preliminary but potentially important findings when working with adults from low-income populations: first, while all participants read some parts of the consent forms (55%), only a minority reported reading the entire form (45%); second, 73% of participants reported understanding the study very well whereas only 27% reported understanding the study \"a little\"; third, there was a slight reported advantage of the simplified form over the regular form; however, this difference varied by section. relatedly, other research has shown a high incidence of persons reading none of the consent form, but signing a statement that they have read and understood the study. why does this occur? what are we teaching people when we request that they sign a consent form they have chosen not to read? what are the ethical and regulatory implications? embedded ethics studies such as this one, although pilot and preliminary in nature, offer a number of advantages, such as stimulating additional scientific inquiry as well as challenging established institutional practices. the author(s) 2015.","background: approximately 20% of adult cancer patients are eligible to participate in a clinical trial, but only 2.5-9% do so. accrual is even less for minority and medically underserved populations. as a result, critical life-saving treatments and quality of life services developed from research studies may not address their needs. this study questions the utility of the bioethical concern with therapeutic misconception (tm), a misconception that occurs when research subjects fail to distinguish between clinical research and ordinary treatment, and therefore attribute therapeutic intent to research procedures in the safety net setting. this paper provides ethnographic insight into the ways in which research is discussed and related to standard treatment.; methods: in the course of two years of ethnographic fieldwork in a safety net hospital, i conducted clinic observations (n=150 clinic days) and in-depth in-person qualitative interviews with patients (n=37) and providers (n=15). i used standard qualitative methods to organize and code resulting fieldnote and interview data.; results: findings suggest that tm is limited in relevance for the interdisciplinary context of cancer clinical trial recruitment in the safety net setting. ethnographic data show the value of the discussions that happen prior to the informed consent, those that introduce the idea of participation in research. these preliminary discussions are elemental especially when recruiting underserved and vulnerable patients for clinical trial participation who are often unfamiliar with medical research and how it relates to medical care. data also highlight the multiple actors involved in research discussions and the ethics of social justice and patient advocacy they mobilize, suggesting that class, inequality, and dependency influence the forms of ethical engagements in public hospital settings.; conclusion: on the ground ethics of social justice and patient advocacy are more relevant than tm as guiding ethical principles in the context of ongoing cancer disparities and efforts to diversify clinical trial participation.","background: many prognostic models have been developed. different types of models, i.e. prognostic factor and outcome prediction studies, serve different purposes, which should be reflected in how the results are summarized in reviews. therefore we set out to investigate how authors of reviews synthesize and report the results of primary outcome prediction studies.; methods: outcome prediction reviews published in medline between october 2005 and march 2011 were eligible and 127 systematic reviews with the aim to summarize outcome prediction studies written in english were identified for inclusion.characteristics of the reviews and the primary studies that were included were independently assessed by 2 review authors, using standardized forms.; results: after consensus meetings a total of 50 systematic reviews that met the inclusion criteria were included. the type of primary studies included (prognostic factor or outcome prediction) was unclear in two-thirds of the reviews. a minority of the reviews reported univariable or multivariable point estimates and measures of dispersion from the primary studies. moreover, the variables considered for outcome prediction model development were often not reported, or were unclear. in most reviews there was no information about model performance. quantitative analysis was performed in 10 reviews, and 49 reviews assessed the primary studies qualitatively. in both analyses types a range of different methods was used to present the results of the outcome prediction studies.; conclusions: different methods are applied to synthesize primary study results but quantitative analysis is rarely performed. the description of its objectives and of the primary studies is suboptimal and performance parameters of the outcome prediction models are rarely mentioned. the poor reporting and the wide variety of data synthesis strategies are prone to influence the conclusions of outcome prediction reviews. therefore, there is much room for improvement in reviews of outcome prediction studies.","questions under study: although the ethical and health implications of neuroenhancement have been intensely discussed over the past years, little is known about the experiences and attitudes of physicians confronted with requests for neuroenhancing substances. the aim of this study was to explore general practitioners' and psychiatrists' familiarity with such requests and their willingness to prescribe these products.; method: a nation-wide cross-sectional survey among general practitioners and psychiatrists in switzerland was conducted. a questionnaire was developed, pre-tested and sent out to a pre-defined sample of 1,600 swiss practising physicians in the fields of psychiatry and general practice/internal medicine in the german-speaking and french-speaking part of switzerland.; results: a total of 393 questionnaires were returned (response rate: 24.7%). 80.2% of study participants were encountered requests for neuroenhancing products in their own practice, mostly not exceeding 1-2 times a year. a total of 41.1% were undecided when asked if they categorically against neuroenhancement, 49% would decide on a case-by-case basis, and 9.6% would decide according to patients' wishes.; conclusions: swiss psychiatrists and general practitioners are confronted with requests for neuroenhancement, albeit not very frequently. most participants embrace a pragmatic position towards neuroenhancement, although there is also a considerable degree of uncertainty about the appropriateness of a categorical refusal. a minority would follow a consumer model that leaves the decision about the use of neuroenhancers to the client, even though this conflicts with legal requirements regarding drug prescriptions.","because of increased attention to the issue of trustworthiness of clinical practice guidelines, it may be that both transparency and management of industry associations of guideline development groups (gdgs) have improved. the purpose of the present study was to assess a) the disclosure requirements of gdgs in a cross-section of guidelines for major depression; and, b) the extent and type of conflicts of panel members. treatment guidelines for major depression were identified and searched for conflict of interest policies and disclosure statements. multi-modal screens for undeclared conflicts were also conducted. fourteen guidelines with a total of 172 panel members were included in the analysis. eleven of the 14 guidelines (78%) had a stated conflict of interest policy or disclosure statement, although the policies varied widely. most (57%) of the guidelines were developed by panels that had members with industry financial ties to drug companies that manufacture antidepressant medication. however, only a minority of total panel members (18%) had such conflicts of interest. drug company speakers bureau participation was the most common type of conflict. although some progress has been made, organizations that develop guidelines should continue to work toward greater transparency and minimization of financial conflicts of interest.","the impact of medical ghostwriting, a violation of authorship ethics, remains unclear within the biomedical literature and among the public, potentially raising concerns about the integrity of the biomedical evidence base. core texts in authorship and ghostwriting from the clinical literature and the 2010 senate minority report on ghostwriting were reviewed as were uses of the term 'ghostwriting' in contemporary (2009-2011) and more recent (2015-2016) journalistic news coverage originally printed in english. journalistic coverage oversimplified key concerns about ghostwriting identified by the medical community and the us government. more recent journalistic uses of the term 'ghostwriting' suggest confusion with topics such as financial disclosures or patient monitoring. pharmaism in the medical literature, an expression of bias against pharmaceutical companies that casts doubt on the credibility of physicians and scientists, may be a source for confusion. the tendency for medical journal editors to discuss ghostwriting in the context of clinical trial transparency or data integrity is another possible source for misinterpretation via oversimplification. journalistic descriptions of ghostwriting consistently downplay the critical reasoning abilities and competence of practising physicians and deflect attention away from patient concerns and back to pharmaceutical companies. some uses of the term ghostwriting in news coverage may implicitly undercut belief in the competence of physicians, a troubling trend. further work is needed to characterise the impact of ghostwriting in the medical literature and to reassure the public that their trust in medical practitioners is well placed. 2016 john wiley &amp;

methods: we conducted in-person interviews with 253 patients in cancer-research trials (a 93% response rate) at five u.s. medical centers to determine their attitudes regarding potential financial conflicts of interest among researchers and medical centers.; results: more than 90% of patients expressed little or no worry about financial ties that researchers or institutions might have with drug companies. most patients said they would have enrolled in the trial even if the drug company had paid the researcher for speaking (82% of those interviewed) or consulting (75%) or if the researcher had received royalty payments (70%) or owned stock in the company (76%). similarly, most patients would have enrolled in the trial if their cancer center had owned stock in the drug company (77%) or received royalty payments from the company (79%). most patients believed it was ethical for researchers to receive speaking fees (81%) or consulting fees (82%) from the company. however, a substantial minority of patients wanted disclosure of the oversight system for researchers (40%) and of researchers' financial interests (31%); 17% thought no disclosure to patients was necessary.; conclusions: most patients in cancer-research trials were not worried about financial ties between researchers or medical centers and drug companies and would still have enrolled in the trial if they had known about such financial ties. a substantial minority wanted to be informed about the oversight system to protect against financial conflicts of interest and about researchers' financial interests. copyright 2006 massachusetts medical society.","background: there has been ethical concern that participants in psychiatric research will become distressed and their mental state might worsen.; method: a systematic search was carried out for studies that examined distress following participation in research that involved the assessment of psychiatric state or associated risk factors. there were 46 relevant studies.; results: a minority of participants become distressed immediately after participation, with distress more likely in studies of traumatic experiences. there is limited evidence on longer-term effects, but what there is suggests no adverse impact. positive reactions to participation show little association with distress and these are more common than negative reactions. very few studies of distress in research have used control groups to establish causal associations. however, what evidence there is suggests no causal role, including for research on suicidality. researchers in this area have made a range of suggestions about ethical practice.; conclusions: a minority of participants in psychiatric research become distressed, but there is no evidence of longer-term harm. nevertheless, researchers need to take account of ethical concerns in designing studies. future research in the area needs to be carried out with stronger designs involving control groups.","introduction: with the recent merger of the american osteopathic association (aoa) and the accreditation council for graduate medical education (acgme) a heightened pressure for publication may become evident. our objective was to determine whether there was a gap in the type of both medical degree designation and advanced degree designation among authorship in three united states-based academic emergency medicine journals.; methods: we reviewed the journal of emergency medicine, academic emergency medicine and annals of emergency medicine for the type of degree designation that the first and senior authors had obtained for the years 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014.; results: a total of 2.48% of all authors held a degree in osteopathic medicine. osteopathic physician first authors contributed to 3.26% of all publications while osteopathic physician senior authors contributed 1.53%. no statistical trend could be established for the years studied for osteopathic physicians. however, we noted an overall trend for increased publication for allopathic senior authors (p=0.001), allopathic first authors with a dual degree (p=0.003) and allopathic senior authors with a dual degree (p=0.005). for each journal studied, no statistical trend could be established for osteopathic first or senior authors but a trend was noted for allopathic first and senior authors in the journal of emergency medicine (p-value=0.020 and 0.006). of those with dual degrees, osteopathic physicians were in the minority with 1.85% of osteopathic first authors and 0.60% of osteopathic senior authors attaining a dual degree. no statistical trend could be established for increased dual degree publications for osteopathic physicians over the study period, nor could a statistical trend be established for any of the journals studied.; conclusion: very few osteopathic physicians have published in the journal of emergency medicine, academic emergency medicine or annals of emergency medicine over the last two decades. despite a trend for increased publication by allopathic physicians in certain journals, there appears to be no trend for increased publication of osteopathic physicians in emergency medicine.","background: prediction models are used in clinical research to develop rules that can be used to accurately predict the outcome of the patients based on some of their characteristics. they represent a valuable tool in the decision making process of clinicians and health policy makers, as they enable them to estimate the probability that patients have or will develop a disease, will respond to a treatment, or that their disease will recur. the interest devoted to prediction models in the biomedical community has been growing in the last few years. often the data used to develop the prediction models are class-imbalanced as only few patients experience the event (and therefore belong to minority class).; results: prediction models developed using class-imbalanced data tend to achieve sub-optimal predictive accuracy in the minority class. this problem can be diminished by using sampling techniques aimed at balancing the class distribution. these techniques include under- and oversampling, where a fraction of the majority class samples are retained in the analysis or new samples from the minority class are generated. the correct assessment of how the prediction model is likely to perform on independent data is of crucial importance; in the absence of an independent data set, cross-validation is normally used. while the importance of correct cross-validation is well documented in the biomedical literature, the challenges posed by the joint use of sampling techniques and cross-validation have not been addressed.; conclusions: we show that care must be taken to ensure that cross-validation is performed correctly on sampled data, and that the risk of overestimating the predictive accuracy is greater when oversampling techniques are used. examples based on the re-analysis of real datasets and simulation studies are provided. we identify some results from the biomedical literature where the incorrect cross-validation was performed, where we expect that the performance of oversampling techniques was heavily overestimated.","objective: this systematic review sought to conduct a general analysis of the brazilian scientific output on autism spectrum disorders (asd) published between 2002 and 2009.; methods: a literature search was conducted in the scientific databases pubmed, scielo, and lilacs and in the capes portal, using keywords such as \"autism\" and \"pervasive developmental disorders\".; results: a total of 93 articles were identified, most of which were authored by researchers from southeast brazil and affiliated with public universities. approximately one-third of all articles were published in journals with an impact factor ranging from 0.441 to 3.211; most were based on small sample sizes. furthermore, 140 theses and dissertations were identified, 82.1% of which were master's theses. interventions for asd were the predominant research topic.; conclusion: brazilian researchers are clearly interested in the topic of asd; however, a substantial portion of their scientific output is limited to doctoral dissertations or master's theses. a minority of articles was published in journals with a high impact factor. these findings suggest the need for studies with larger sample sizes, which could produce higher-impact findings and thus increase visibility of the brazilian scientific output in the field of asd research.","the center for research on minority health has translated the biopsychosocial framework to address global cancer health disparities through the integration of biological (eg, endogenous steroids, genetic susceptibility, and pesticide levels) and behavioral (eg, dietary interventions) determinants, along with community-based research (eg, comprehensive involvement of community advisory boards) and educational approaches (eg, kindergarten through postgraduate training). evidence of successful implementation of this framework includes health disparities training for &gt;2000 individuals ranging from elementary to the postgraduate level, and conducting transdisciplinary projects that incorporate traditional and nontraditional health professionals to examine associations between biological and nonbiological determinants of health. examples and recommendations for implementation of the biopsychosocial approach as it applies to cancer health disparities research are described.","background: demographic changes likely to occur in the near future and the need for planning to address them are behind the urgent drive to assess present-day provision and utilization of low-vision rehabilitation (lvr) services in the community. perhaps even more important is the assessment of supporting research work in this field of health care. the purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate the current involvement of researchers in canada in the elucidation of the lvr sciences.; methods: a pubmed search of the medline database was performed. publications were identified according to preset criteria and search key words pertinent to various aspects of lvr sciences. data were collected on the corresponding authors and their affiliations, type of journal and type of study performed, and reported outcome measures.; results: approximately 1500 papers were reviewed, and 131 that met the preset criteria were included in the study. medical doctors published most papers (48.1%), followed by optometrists, those with phds, occupational therapists, and others; most of the papers (44.3%) were published in ophthalmology journals. research was performed mainly at canadian universities (84%), and the findings were published in the last 3 decades. the studies largely concentrated on rehabilitation services and other aspects of vision rehabilitation (55%), whereas studies focusing on the evaluation of tools used for assessment of either visual functions or functional vision were in the minority (45%).; interpretation: the majority of research activity in canada is university based and involves the medical profession in a leading role, thus affording lvr the appropriate medium for promotion and development of a multidisciplinary approach to outstanding research issues. only a fraction of current research in lvr (12.2%) deals with outcome measures of the therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring functional vision.","this paper reports the findings of a research study funded by the english national board for nursing, midwifery and health visiting (enb), which explored the impact of community care reforms on mental health and learning disability nurses and their practice. in this study we were struck by the divergent views of our respondents about the nature of mental health and learning disability nursing as practice disciplines and the implications of these views for the future shape of preregistration educational preparation. we noted, in particular, the debate between those who advocate what is referred to as specialist educational preparation and others who favour generic preparation. the specialist-generic debate is relevant to nursing as a whole but was magnified in the context of our study because genericism was perceived by many of our respondents as a threat to the minority branches and especially to those (arguably mental health and learning disability) that are not rooted in the biomedical tradition of general nursing. this paper seeks to contribute to this debate as it impinges on the two nursing specialties by developing models of future nurse education grounded in the empirical data from our research and interrogating them to draw out their central features. two models are clearly independent: the 'specialist' and the 'generic' models. another three models are partial in that they draw upon the first two: the 'pragmatic' model, the 'unity-of-nursing' model, and the 'social care' model. a common feature of the pragmatic and unity-of-nursing models is that they support the existing diphe programme, which is now the dominant form of preregistration nurse preparation in the uk. the social care model is applicable principally to learning disability nursing.","background: nodding syndrome has increasingly become an issue of public health concern internationally. the etiology of the disorder is still unknown and there are yet no curative treatments. we explored perceptions about treatment practices and barriers to health seeking for nodding syndrome in pader and kitgum districts in northern uganda in order to provide data necessary for informing policy on treatment adherence and rehabilitations.; methods: we used focus group discussions and individual interviews to gain deep insights into help-seeking and treatment practices for nodding syndrome. purposive sampling was used to identify information-rich participants that included village health teams, community members not directly affected with nodding syndrome, district leaders, healthcare professionals, and caregivers of children affected with nodding syndrome. we used qualitative content analysis to analyze data and presented findings under distinct categories and themes.; results: caregivers and communities sought care from multiple sources including biomedical facilities, traditional healers, traditional rituals from shrines, and spiritual healing. nodding syndrome affected children reportedly have showed no enduring improvement with traditional medicines, traditional rituals, and prayers. a substantial minority of participants reported minimal improvements in symptoms of convulsions with use of western medicines. challenges involved in health seeking included; (1) health system factors e.g. long distances to facilities, frequent unavailability of medicines, few healthcare providers, and long waiting times; (2) contextual and societal challenges e.g. lack of money for transport and medical bills, overburdening nature of the illness that does not allow time for other activities, and practical difficulties involved in transporting the physically deformed and mentally retarded children to the health facilities.; conclusions: help-seeking for nodding syndrome is pluralistic and include use of traditional and biomedical practices. western medicines admittedly showed at least short term control on nodding syndrome symptoms, especially convulsions and led in a few cases to regain of functional abilities. however, multiple barriers hinder health seeking and interfere with adherence to biomedical treatments. regarding cure, there are hitherto no treatments participants perceive cure nodding syndrome.","this study examined the role of prospective payment systems in the adoption of new medical technologies across different countries. a literature review was conducted to provide background for the study and guide development of a survey instrument. the survey was disseminated to hospital payment systems experts in 15 jurisdictions. fifty-one surveys were disseminated, with 34 returned. the surveys returned covered 14 of the 15 jurisdictions invited to participate. the majority (71%) of countries update the patient classification system and/or payment tariffs on an annual basis to try to account for new technologies. use of short-term separate or supplementary payments for new technologies occurs in 79% of countries to ensure adequate funding and facilitate adoption. a minority (43%) of countries use evidence of therapeutic benefit and/or costs to determine or update payment tariffs, although it is somewhat more common in establishing short-term payments. the main barrier to using evidence is uncertain or unavailable clinical evidence. almost three-fourths of respondents believed diagnosis-related group systems incentivize or deter technology adoption, depending on the particular circumstances. improvements are needed, such as enhanced strategies for evidence generation and linking evidence of value to payments, national and international collaboration and training to improve existing practice, and flexible timelines for short-term payments. importantly, additional research is needed to understand how different payment policies impact technology uptake as well as quality of care and costs.","background: although various assessments pertaining to the surgical aspect of mohs micrographic surgery (mms) have been performed, the pivotal role played by the mms histotechnician (mh) has not previously been addressed in the uk.; aim: to undertake a review of the training and practice of mhs in all centres performing mms within the national health service (nhs) in the uk.; methods: nhs dermatology departments performing mms in the uk were identified and contacted by telephone between november 2011 and january 2012. mms practice data pertaining to the role of the mh in tissue processing was collected by speaking directly to a histotechnician in each department.; results: in total, 29 centres were identified. the number of mhs at each centre varied from 1 to 13 (median 3). all mhs had undergraduate degrees in biomedical science. most (85%) mhs worked full-time under the directorate of their local pathology department. in 19 centres (66%), the mohs surgeon reviewed the slides, and in the remaining 10 centres (34%), a consultant histopathologist reviewed the slides, either alone or in partnership with the mohs surgeon. there was significant variation in tissue handling and processing techniques across the centres. all centres used mms to treat primarily high-risk basal cell carcinomas, with over half (55%) also treating squamous cell carcinomas. mhs from all centres had learned about the specifics of mms tissue processing 'on the job', with a minority having received formal training by attending a larger mms centre or an mms course.; conclusions: significant variation in mms tissue-processing techniques exists across the uk. a standard of practice should perhaps be considered, as this has risk-management, quality-control and possible medicolegal implications. 2013 british association of dermatologists.","this paper describes a 16-month health education pilot program based on diffusion of innovation and social network theories. the program was implemented by volunteer community liaisons for the purposes of increasing awareness of and support for hiv vaccine research in minority populations. this theoretically driven pilot program allowed the liaisons to integrate delivery of the hiv vaccine research messages created for the program into their existing activities and routines. through training in participatory engagement, volunteers were able to tailor and adapt an hiv prevention message for their communities. process evaluation data showed that the acceptance of participatory engagement and hiv vaccine message dissemination far exceeded expectations. the anticipated number of community members to receive the message was estimated at 500 with 10 volunteer liaisons or 50 per person. however, the actual number of people reached was 644, with only 7 volunteer liaisons, or an average of 92 persons per liaison, almost double the original number. further research is recommended to analyze the specific behavioral changes that can come from the use of social networks in hiv vaccine research awareness within minority populations.","generally, studies have revealed that only a minority of people are bothered by participation in research on traumatic stress. severity of traumatic events and subsequent responses are typically unrelated to negative reactions. we included 386 family members and caregivers (respondents) of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (focus people). focus people (ages 4-82) had a wide range of physical and intellectual disabilities, medical and behavioral problems, and exposure to potentially traumatic events. the measures of impact of research participation (based on j. i. ruzek &amp; d. f. zatzick's [2000] reactions to research participation questionnaire [rrpq]; s. folkman and r. s. lazarus's [1986 , 1988 ] emotional responses to participation scale) showed good psychometric properties. response to participation was highly skewed toward good understanding of informed consent, valuing participation, and minimal negative reactions. number of traumatic events was related, positively, to only one rrpq subscale: valuing participation. implications for research and clinical work are discussed."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Year<\/th>\n      <th>Abstract<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
