<p>After discovering that diversity and its many analougues are rising, but race/ethnicity are stagnating or declining, we began to wonder whether there was a way to test whether diversity was replacing race/ethnicity in biomedical abstracts. Drawing on <ins><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=96&amp;v=AyZJdEfYUjw&amp;feature=emb_logo">Berrey's (2015)</a></ins> argument that diversity acts as a mechanism to whitewash attempts to materially address racial inequality in other contexts, we thought there was a possibility that something similar is happening in biomedicine. Below, we test whether is race, ethnicity and diversity are becoming more or less semantically similar over time. Moreover, we examine whether these terms are becoming more or less semantically similar to other diversity-related terminology over time as well. Understanding these trends should help us better contextualize how diversity is used and what the political implications of such shifts mean for diversity in biomedical research.</p>
