After discovering that diversity and its many analougues are rising, but race/ethnicity are stagnating or declining, we began to wonder whether there was a way to test whether diversity was replacing race/ethnicity in biomedical abstracts. Drawing on <ins>[Berrey's (2015)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=96&v=AyZJdEfYUjw&feature=emb_logo)</ins> argument that diversity acts as a mechanism to whitewash attempts to materially address racial inequality in other contexts, we thought there was a possibility that something similar is happening in biomedicine. Below, we test whether is race, ethnicity and diversity are becoming more or less semantically similar over time. Moreover, we examine whether these terms are becoming more or less semantically similar to other diversity-related terminology over time as well. Understanding these trends should help us better contextualize how diversity is used and what the political implications of such shifts mean for diversity in biomedical research.

To do this, we used Word2Vec - a popular word embedding algorithm that quantifies semantic similarities by creating distributional properties of words based on how often they arise in shared contexts of a text corpus (Mikolev et al. 2013). In such a model, all words are represented as numeric vectors within a n-dimensional embedding space. Essentially, each word has a set of numeric coordinates that allow us to compare all words in this embedding space to one another; words that are closer in the vector space are assumed to have more similar meanings. For more on the specifics of the model, see our paper's methods section.

Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B visualize the top-10 terms in the race, racial, ethnic, ethnicity, diverse and diversity word vectors for the 1990-2000 and 2010-2020 Word2Vec models. To visualize these vectors, we used the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding function from Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn package (Pedregosa et al. 2011), which is an algorithm used to decompose the model into 2 dimensions for plotting. This process allows us to evaluate the vectors relative to one another in a 2-dimensional scatterplot. Above, we find that diversity moves further away from the racial and ethnic vectors over time.
