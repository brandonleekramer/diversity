      <description>To test Hypothesis 1, we conducted word frequency analyses that quantify (1) variation in raw word counts over time and (2) the proportion of publications that the term is used in each year. These terms included various diversity-related terms, including aging, ancestry, cultural, diversity, genetic, minority, population, race/ethnicity, sex/gender and sexuality. Although we did not include religious and linguistic terms in our final visualizations, we did analyze these terms, finding little change in their use over time.</description>

      <description>Next, we return to the diversity corpus to test Hypothesis 2. Here, we examine whether the use of population terminology has grown in biomedical abstracts over the past three decades. To do this, we build on Panofsky and Bliss’s (2017) exploration of how research scientists enact population differences using a polyvocality of terms, including geographic classifications like continents, countries, and cardinal directions (i.</description>

      <description>To test Hypothesis 3, we parsed our dictionary of 2,200+ population terms into a set of more nuanced analytic categories. Our main objective is to test Fujimura and Rajagopalan’s (2011) assertion that researchers now use biogeographic terms more often than race and ethnicity in their studies. Once again, following Panofsky and Bliss (2017), we looked at the use of continent, country, and directional terminology, US-specific terms (corresponding to the US Census and OMB Directive 15 labeling schema), a category of general population terms (i.</description>

      <description>Finally, to test Hypothesis 4, we evaluated the geographical basis of population terminology use and variation in US-specific racial and ethnic categories over time. We did in two steps. First, we extracted and parsed all of the address information of authors in our diversity corpus, recoding these data into ISO Alpha-2 country codes. We then examined how often all population terms (i.</description>
