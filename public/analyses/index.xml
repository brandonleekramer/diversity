      <description>Over the past several years, social scientists have noted that the discourse of “diversity” is expanding in use across various social contexts (Berrey 2015). In this project, we are interested in measuring how often diversity and its various metonyms are mentioned in biomedical research over the three decades (1990-2017). Our first working hypothesis is that:
 The use of the term ‘diversity’ and its related terminology has increased in biomedical abstracts since 1990.</description>

      <description>While our first set of analyses established that “diversity” is increasing modestly in the biomedical literature, we also wanted to account for how terminology related to population testing has changed over time. Fujimura and Rajagopalan’s (2011) have suggested that researchers now use biogeographic and genetic ancestry terms more often than race and ethnicity in their studies. Relatedly, Panofsky and Bliss (2017) have found that racial and ethnic terms (including those within the US Census and OMB Directive 15 labeling schema) have been replaced by more general biogeographic terms such continental, national, and directional terminology.</description>

      <description>To test Hypothesis 3, we evaluated the geographical basis of population terminology use and variation in US-specific racial and ethnic categories over time. First, we extracted and parsed all of the address information of authors in our diversity corpus, recoding these data into ISO Alpha-2 country codes. We then examined how often all population terms (i.e. the dictionary of 8,200+ terms) were used from researchers in each country across both the biomedical and diversity samples.</description>
