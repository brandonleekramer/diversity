While these authors speak to the discourse of diversity being a mechanism for domininant (white) racial groups in power to pay lip service to racial inequity without addressing these problems through the reallocation of resources, our interest in diversity is to better understand how it is used in biomedical research.</description>

      <description>/* this chunk of code centers all of the headings */ h1, h2, h3, h4 { text-align: center; }  Next, we wanted to examine the growth of OMB Directive 15 and US Census terms. Initially, we posed this hypothesis:
 H2: The use of US-specific racial and ethnic terms have increased in biomedical abstracts from 1990-2020.   
To test this assertion, we compiled a dictionary used to catch to the main OMB/US Census terms, including Asian, White, Black, Native American, Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latinx as well as more general terms like race and ethnicity.</description>

      <description>/* this chunk of code centers all of the headings */ h1, h2, h3, h4 { text-align: center; }  While our first set of analyses established that “diversity” is increasing in the biomedical literature, we also wanted to account for how terminology related to population testing has changed over time. For example, Panofsky and Bliss (2017) have found that racial and ethnic terms (including those within the US Census and OMB Directive 15 labeling schema) have been replaced by more general geographic terms such continental, national, and directional terminology.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis 4</title>
      <link>/results/hypothesis4/</link>

      <description>/* this chunk of code centers all of the headings */ h1, h2, h3, h4 { text-align: center; }  After discovering that diversity and its many analougues are rising, but race/ethnicity are stagnating or declining, we began to wonder whether there was a way to test whether diversity was replacing race/ethnicity in biomedical abstracts. Drawing on Berrey’s (2015) argument that diversity acts as a mechanism to whitewash attempts to materially address racial inequality in other contexts, we thought there was a possibility that something similar is happening in biomedicine.</description>
