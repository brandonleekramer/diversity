While these authors speak to the discourse of diversity being a mechanism for domininant (white) racial groups in power to pay lip service to racial inequity without addressing these problems through the reallocation of resources, our interest in diversity is to better understand how it is used in biomedical research.</description>

 H2: The use of US-specific racial and ethnic terms have increased in biomedical abstracts from 1990-2020.   
To test this assertion, we compiled a dictionary used to catch to the main OMB/US Census terms, including Asian, White, Black, Native American, Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latinx as well as more general terms like race and ethnicity.</description>

      <description>/* this chunk of code centers all of the headings */ h1, h2, h3, h4 { text-align: center; }  Overview While our first set of analyses established that &amp;quot;diversity&amp;quot; is increasing in the biomedical literature, we also wanted to account for how terminology related to population testing has changed over time. For example, Panofsky and Bliss (2017) have found that racial and ethnic terms (including those within the US Census and OMB Directive 15 labeling schema) have been replaced by more general biogeographic terms such continental, national, and directional terminology.</description>
