       "'African-Americans have an unexplained increased incidence and mortality from stroke compared with whites, and little is known about stroke in Hispanics. To investigate cross-sectional differences in sociodemographic and stroke risk factors, we prospectively evaluated 430 patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke (black 35%. Hispanic 46%, white 19%) over the age of 39 from Northern Manhattan. Blacks and Hispanics were younger than whites (mean ages, blacks 70, Hispanics 67, whites 80; p < 0.001) and were more likely to have less than 12 years of education than whites. Hypertension was more prevalent in blacks and Hispanics with stroke than whites (blacks 76%, Hispanics 79%, whites 63%; p < 0.05) and was often untreated in blacks. Left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG was more frequent in blacks (blacks 20%, whites 9%; p = 0.02). History of cardiac disease (atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, angina, and congestive heart failure) was less prevalent in both blacks and Hispanics. Black women were significantly more obese than white women (mean Quetelet Index percent, blacks 3.9%, whites 3.6%; p < 0.05). Heavy alcohol use was more often reported by blacks and Hispanics; cigarette smoking was increased only in blacks. Moreover, blacks were less likely to have visited a physician 1 year after their stroke (blacks 85%, whites 98%; p < 0.05), and Hispanics less often lived alone compared with whites. These cross-sectional differences suggest that the burden of stroke risk factors is increased in both blacks and Hispanics with stroke.

It inhibits with high affinity the radioligand binding to rat cortical alpha-2 adrenoceptors, as well as to human platelet alpha-2 adrenoceptors labeled with [3H]idazoxan (Ki = 7 nM). SL 84.0418 has low affinity for alpha-1 adrenoceptors labeled with [3H]prazosin (Ki = 3.3 microM). In vitro, SL 84.0418 has no alpha agonist properties, whereas it is a potent alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist at both pre- and postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors. In contrast, it possesses low potency as an antagonist at postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors demonstrating a more than 1000-fold selectivity toward alpha-2 compared with alpha-1 adrenoceptors. In the same tests, the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan had a selectivity ratio of 200. SL 84.0418 is the racemic mixture of two enantiomers, SL 86.0715 [(+) enantiomer] and SL 86.0714 [(-) enantiomer]. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor blocking activities reside with SL 86.0715. Similar to idazoxan, SL 84.0418 increases in a concentration-dependent manner the electrically evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine from rat hypothalamic slices through the blockade of the presynaptic inhibitory alpha-2 adrenoceptors. In isolated hamster adipocytes, SL 84.0418 potently antagonizes the inhibition of lipolysis induced by UK 14,304. In addition, SL 84.0418 inhibits epinephrine-induced aggregation of rabbit platelets, effects mediated by postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors. SL 84.0418 does not inhibit (IC50 > 1,000 nM) radioligand binding to other receptors or recognition sites, nor does it inhibit calcium, sodium or potassium channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\", \"year\": 1992, \"publication\": \"The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics\", \"period\": \"1990s\"}, {\"x\": -0.1933669000864029, \"y\": -0.04928242787718773, \"context\": \"neighborhood, matched with the victim according to sex, **race**, and age range. crude and adjusted odds ratios\", \"tokens\": \"neighborhood , matched with the victim according to sex , race , and age range . crude and adjusted odds ratios\", \"abstract\": \"BACKGROUND:\\nIt has been suggested that limiting access to firearms could prevent many suicides, but this belief is controversial. To assess the strength of the association between the availability of firearms and suicide, we studied all suicides that took place in the homes of victims in Shelby County, Tennessee, and King County, Washington, over a 32-month period.\\nMETHODS:\\nFor each suicide victim (case subject), we obtained data from police or the medical examiner and interviewed a proxy. Their answers were compared with those of control subjects from the same neighborhood, matched with the victim according to sex, race, and age range. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated with matched-pairs methods.\\nRESULTS:\\nDuring the study period, 803 suicides occurred in the two counties, 565 of which (70 percent) took place in the home of the victim. Fifty-eight percent (326) of these suicides were committed with a firearm. After excluding 11 case subjects for various reasons, we were able to interview 80 percent (442) of the proxies for the case subjects. Matching controls were identified for 99 percent of these subjects, producing 438 matched pairs. Univariate analyses revealed that the case subjects were more likely than the controls to have lived alone, taken prescribed psychotropic medication, been arrested, abused drugs or alcohol, or not graduated from high school. After we controlled for these characteristics through conditional logistic regression, the presence of one or more guns in the home was found to be associated with an increased risk of suicide (adjusted odds ratio, 4.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 8.5).\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\nReady availability of firearms is associated with an increased risk of suicide in the home. Owners of firearms should weigh their reasons for keeping a gun in the home against the possibility that it might someday be used in a suicide.\\n\", \"year\": 1992, \"publication\": \"The New England journal of medicine\", \"period\": \"1990s\"}, {\"x\": -0.19814424216747284, \"y\": -0.08283711224794388, \"context\": \"of men. objective: we assess the influence of **race** on stage stratified cause specific survival of men\", \"tokens\": \"of men . objective : we assess the influence of race on stage st ##rat ##ified cause specific survival of men\", \"abstract\": \"OBJECTIVE:\\nWe assess the influence of race on stage stratified cause specific survival of men with prostate cancer, and Gleason score, age at diagnosis and treatment on potential racial differences in survival.\\nMETHODS:\\nA total of 524 black and 396 white men were diagnosed with prostate cancer at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center between January 1982 and December 1992. Clinical stage was determined by retrospective review of the medical records and Gleason score of biopsy material as assigned by a single uropathologist. Of 611 patients who died the cause of death was determined by retrospective or prospective review of hospital records in 493 and by review of the death certificates in 102. In 16 cases the cause of death was indeterminate. Median potential followup was 112 months (range 60 to 182) and median period of observation was 61 months (range 1 to 182).\\nRESULTS:\\nCause specific survival with stage T1b-2 cancer was lower in 231 black than in 264 white men of all ages (p = 0.02) and lower in 110 black than in 170 white men younger than in 70 years at diagnosis (p = 0.04). Gleason 7 to 10 cancer, which was associated with a less favorable cause specific survival compared to Gleason 2 to 6 cancer (p <0.0001), was more common in black than in white men with stage T1b-2 cancer of all ages (p = 0.01) and younger than 70 years at diagnosis (p = 0.04). No or unknown treatment status, which was associated with a less favorable cause specific survival compared to treatment (p = 0.05), was more common in black than in white men with stage T1b-2 cancer of all ages (p = 0.0005) but not significantly different when stratified by age. In men of all ages racial differences in cause specific survival were not significant when adjusted for age and Gleason score (p = 0.14) or age, Gleason score and treatment status (p = 0.17). In men younger than 70 years racial differences in cause specific survival were not significant when adjusted for age and Gleason score (p = 0.22). There were no significant racial differences in overall or age stratified all cause survival of men with stage T1b-2 cancer. There were no significant differences in overall or age stratified cause specific or all cause survival of 112 black and 58 white men with stage T3-4 cancer, or 181 and 74, respectively, with metastatic cancer.\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\nOur data indicate that local stage prostate cancer is more lethal in black than in white men and the difference is most pronounced in men younger than 70 years. The survival disadvantage of black men with local stage cancer is due in part to a propensity for development of less differentiated and more aggressive malignancies.\\n\", \"year\": 2000, \"publication\": \"The Journal of urology\", \"period\": \"2000s\"}, {\"x\": -0.19023358821868896, \"y\": -0.043747883290052414, \"context\": \"center between january 1990 and november 1998. age, **race**, serum prostate specific antigen ( psa ),\", \"tokens\": \"center between january 1990 and november 1998 . age , race , serum prostate specific antigen ( ps ##a ) ,\", \"abstract\": \"OBJECTIVE:\\nThe reported incidence and mortality of prostate cancer are higher among black than white men.

We review the basic physiology of hair growth, the development of methods for visually quantifying hair growth, the comparison of these methods with objective measurements of hair growth, how hirsutism may be defined using a visual scoring method, the influence of race and ethnicity on hirsutism, and the impact of hirsutism in diagnosing androgen excess and polycystic ovary syndrome.\\nRESULTS:\\nObjective methods for the assessment of hair growth including photographic evaluations and microscopic measurements are available but these techniques have limitations for clinical use, including a significant degree of complexity and a high cost. Alternatively, methods for visually scoring or quantifying the amount of terminal body and facial hair growth have been in use since the early 1920s; these methods are semi-quantitative at best and subject to significant inter-observer variability.

Male-to-female incidence rate ratios did not differ by race, but were 4.2 for pediatric (0-19 years), 4.1 for adult (20-59 years) and 2.0 for geriatric (> or = 60 years) BL. Cross-sectional age-specific rates showed 2 separate peaks among males and females, near ages 10 and 75 years, and a 3rd peak near age 40 years among males. The tri/bimodal incidence pattern was present in sensitivity analyses excluding registries with many HIV/AIDS cases and in period-specific, cohort-specific analyses. To our knowledge, tri/bimodal incidence patterns have not previously been reported for BL. Trimodal/bimodal BL suggests heterogeneity in etiology or biology of BL diagnosed at different ages in males and females.\", \"year\": 2010, \"publication\": \"International journal of cancer\", \"period\": \"2010s\"}]}}, {\"mode\": \"vega-lite\"});\n",

It inhibits with high affinity the radioligand binding to rat cortical alpha-2 adrenoceptors, as well as to human platelet alpha-2 adrenoceptors labeled with [3H]idazoxan (Ki = 7 nM). SL 84.0418 has low affinity for alpha-1 adrenoceptors labeled with [3H]prazosin (Ki = 3.3 microM). In vitro, SL 84.0418 has no alpha agonist properties, whereas it is a potent alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist at both pre- and postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors. In contrast, it possesses low potency as an antagonist at postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors demonstrating a more than 1000-fold selectivity toward alpha-2 compared with alpha-1 adrenoceptors. In the same tests, the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan had a selectivity ratio of 200.

The identification of mRNA for a CFTR homologue in the Xenopus oocyte and early stages of development has implications for its biological role.\", \"year\": 1992, \"publication\": \"Human molecular genetics\", \"period\": \"1990s\"}, {\"x\": -0.0956195816397667, \"y\": -0.039657436311244965, \"context\": \"increased receptor synthesis. the first step in generating cellular **diversity** in the drosophila central nervous system is the\", \"tokens\": \"increased receptor synthesis . the first step in generating cellular diversity in the dr ##oso ##phila central nervous system is the\", \"word\": \"diversity\", \"abstract\": \"The first step in generating cellular diversity in the Drosophila central nervous system is the formation of a segmentally reiterated array of neural precursor cells, called neuroblasts.

Their answers were compared with those of control subjects from the same neighborhood, matched with the victim according to sex, race, and age range. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated with matched-pairs methods.\\nRESULTS:\\nDuring the study period, 803 suicides occurred in the two counties, 565 of which (70 percent) took place in the home of the victim. Fifty-eight percent (326) of these suicides were committed with a firearm. After excluding 11 case subjects for various reasons, we were able to interview 80 percent (442) of the proxies for the case subjects. Matching controls were identified for 99 percent of these subjects, producing 438 matched pairs. Univariate analyses revealed that the case subjects were more likely than the controls to have lived alone, taken prescribed psychotropic medication, been arrested, abused drugs or alcohol, or not graduated from high school. After we controlled for these characteristics through conditional logistic regression, the presence of one or more guns in the home was found to be associated with an increased risk of suicide (adjusted odds ratio, 4.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 8.5).\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\nReady availability of firearms is associated with an increased risk of suicide in the home.

Log rank tests were used to determine the homogeneity of survival functions between black and white men with similar PSA ranges, and between groups defined by age specific PSA reference ranges for each race.\\nRESULTS:\\nDisease stage and grade were similar or worse in black men for any PSA range, and biochemical disease-free survival was similar or worse within each range.

The C5 proteasome subunit-derived RRFFPYYV and RRFFPYYVY peptides are natural B*2705 ligands. The octamer is an allospecific CTL epitope. Digestion of a 27-mer fragment of C5 revealed that both ligands are generated from this precursor substrate with the 20S proteasome in vitro in a ratio comparable to that in the B*2705-bound peptide pool. The C5 sequence allowed to derive a nested set of six additional peptides with 8-11 residues containing the core octamer sequence and the Arg2 motif of HLA-B27, none of which was found in the B27-bound pool. Together, low proteasomal yield, disfavored TAP-binding motifs, and low affinity for B*2705 accounted for the absence of four of the six peptides. The two remaining differed from the natural octamer or nonamer ligands only by an additional N-terminal Ser residue. Their stability in complex with B*2705 was lower than the respective natural ligands, raising the possibility that N-terminal trimming might have favored a shift toward the more stable peptides. The results suggest that the B*2705-bound peptide repertoire has a highly restricted diversity around a core alloantigenic sequence. This is not explained by a single bottleneck feature, but by multiple factors, including proteasomal generation, TAP-binding motifs, MHC-binding efficiency, and perhaps optimized stability through N-terminal trimming.

In mammalian cells, the induction of the heat shock response requires the activation and translocation to the nucleus of one or more heat shock transcription factors which control the expression of a specific set of genes encoding cytoprotective heat shock proteins. The discovery that the heat shock response is turned on under several pathological conditions and contributes to establish a cytoprotective state in a variety of human diseases, including ischemia, inflammation, and infection, has opened new perspectives in medicine and pharmacology, as molecules activating this defense mechanism appear as possible candidates for novel cytoprotective drugs.

They correspond to a gene family located on human chromosome 9q34 produced by genomic duplications: two new odorant-binding protein genes ( hOBP (IIa) and hOBP (IIb) ), the previously described tear lipocalin LCN1 gene and two new LCN1 pseudogenes.

Both were expressed in the male deferent ducts and placenta. Surprisingly, alternatively spliced mRNAs resulting in proteins with different C-termini were generated from each of the two genes.

The most notable oxysterol activities center around the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, which appears to be controlled in part by a complex series of interactions of oxysterol ligands with various receptors, such as the oxysterol binding protein, the cellular nucleic acid binding protein, the sterol regulatory element binding protein, the LXR nuclear orphan receptors, and the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Identification of the endogenous oxysterol ligands and elucidation of their enzymatic origins are topics of active investigation. Except for 24, 25-epoxysterols, most oxysterols arise from cholesterol by autoxidation or by specific microsomal or mitochondrial oxidations, usually involving cytochrome P-450 species. Oxysterols are variously metabolized to esters, bile acids, steroid hormones, cholesterol, or other sterols through pathways that may differ according to the type of cell and mode of experimentation (in vitro, in vivo, cell culture). Reliable measurements of oxysterol levels and activities are hampered by low physiological concentrations (approximately 0.01-0.1 microM plasma) relative to cholesterol (approximately 5,000 microM) and by the susceptibility of cholesterol to autoxidation, which produces artifactual oxysterols that may also have potent activities. Reports describing the occurrence and levels of oxysterols in plasma, low-density lipoproteins, various tissues, and food products include many unrealistic data resulting from inattention to autoxidation and to limitations of the analytical methodology. Because of the widespread lack of appreciation for the technical difficulties involved in oxysterol research, a rigorous evaluation of the chromatographic and spectroscopic methods used in the isolation, characterization, and quantitation of oxysterols has been included.

The influence of these compounds on cytokine production or immune system function remains unclear. In this study we have examined the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and XEs on chemoattractant cytokine (chemokine) production and analyzed the molecular mechanism. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), also termed monocyte chemotactic and activating factor, is a member of the chemokine family and attracts mainly blood monocytes. Human mammary tumor cell line MCF-7 cells produce a large quantity of MCP-1 in response to interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha). Addition of E2 to MCF-7 cells inhibited MCP-1 production in a dose-dependent manner. XEs, bisphenol A, and NP also inhibited MCP-1 production, although the potency was 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than that of E2. E2, bisphenol A, and NP inhibited MCP-1 messenger RNA expression in MCF-7 cells. Two closely located nuclear factor-kappaB sites, A1 and A2, have been identified in the promoter of the human MCP-1 gene. A luciferase construct containing this enhancer region (pGLM-ENH) was activated by IL-1alpha, and a mutation at either the A1 or A2 site resulted in a loss of IL-1alpha responsiveness. Treatment with E2 or XEs decreased the IL-1alpha-inducible pGLM-ENH luciferase activity significantly. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift analysis, we found that treatment with E2 or XEs diminished the IL-1alpha-induced complex formation with both A1 and A2 probes, which was identified immunochemically to consist of nuclear factor-kappaB, p50, and p65. The IL-1alpha-induced p50/c-Rel complex to the A2 probe was also, to a lesser extent, decreased by E2 or XE treatment. The effects of E2 and XEs on the expression of MCP-1 seem to be much more dramatic than the effects of these agents on the promoters used in the luciferase assay, suggesting the involvement of an additional site(s) of the promoter region of the MCP-1 gene or posttranscriptional regulation of MCP-1 gene expression by E2 and XEs.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), third edition answered this need by introducing operationalized diagnostic criteria that were field-tested for interrater reliability. Unfortunately, the focus on reliability came at a time when the scientific understanding of mental disorders was embryonic and could not yield valid disease definitions. Based on accreting problems with the current DSM-fourth edition (DSM-IV) classification, it is apparent that validity will not be achieved simply by refining criteria for existing disorders or by the addition of new disorders. Yet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria dominate thinking about mental disorders in clinical practice, research, treatment development, and law. As a result, the modern DSM system, intended to create a shared language, also creates epistemic blinders that impede progress toward valid diagnoses.

In addition, the mutant animals show pleiotropic effects that include facial dysmorphism, dwarfing, male sterility, anemia, and cystic choroid plexus. We previously fine-mapped the kat(2J) mutation to a genetic distance of 0.28 +/- 0.12 centimorgan between D8Mit128 and D8Mit129. To identify the underlying molecular defect in this locus, we constructed an integrated genetic and physical map of the critical region surrounding the kat(2J) mutation. Cloning and expression analysis of the transcribed sequences from this region identified Nek1, a NIMA (never in mitosis A)-related kinase as a candidate gene. Further analysis of the Nek1 gene from both kat/kat and kat(2J)/kat(2J) mutant animals identified a partial internal deletion and a single-base insertion as the molecular basis for these mutations. The complex pleiotropic phenotypes seen in the homozygous mutant animals suggest that the NEK1 protein participates in different signaling pathways to regulate diverse cellular processes.

One of them is cardiovascular disease leading to increased risk of stroke, thrombosis, pulmonary, embolism, in which hyperactivation of blood platelets is involved. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of the second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, and a typical neuroleptic - haloperidol - on the one step of platelet activation-platelet aggregation induced by collagen in vitro. Blood was collected into buffered sodium citrate (3.8%) and centrifuged to get platelet-rich plasma (PRP). In PRP (2x10(8) platelets/ml) obtained from healthy volunteers that was incubated with antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, haloperidol; 30 min) aggregation of blood platelets was measured using a Chrono-Log Lumi-aggregometer. Aggregation of platelets was measured after stimulation of platelets with 1 microl of collagen (2 microg/ml).\\nRESULTS:\\nClozapine, like haloperidol reduced platelet aggregation induced by collagen (inhibition of platelet aggregation reached about 20%) (P=1x10(-5) and P=0.003, respectively). Risperidone had also a weak antiaggregatory effect (P=0.05). Among tested antipsychotics only olanzapine had no effect on collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation (P>0.05).\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\nThe obtained results indicate that the difference in action of tested drugs on platelet aggregation may dependent on the various chemical structures of these drugs. Clozapine, risperidone and haloperidol are structurally diverse, and they all significantly reduce platelet aggregability induced by collagen. On the other hand, a close structural analog of clozapine - olanzapine - did not inhibit platelet aggregation. However, mechanism of antipsychotics action on blood platelets is not clear. Moreover, it seems that clozapine, risperidone and haloperidol treatment due to antiaggregatory action may have even some antithrombotic effects.\\n\", \"year\": 2010, \"publication\": \"The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry\", \"period\": \"2010s\"}, {\"x\": -0.09392805397510529, \"y\": -0.0004939029458910227, \"context\": \"extremes of the dose requirements in geographically and ethnically **diverse** patient populations, is needed before the role of a\", \"tokens\": \"extremes of the dose requirements in geographically and ethnic ##ally diverse patient populations , is needed before the role of a\", \"word\": \"diverse\", \"abstract\": \"Genetic susceptibility to type 1 autoimmune hepatitis is indicated by a preponderance of female subjects and strong associations with human leukocyte antigens (HLA) DRB1*0301 and DRB1*0401.

The genotype distribution was significantly different in patients compared to controls (AA = 50/155 patients vs. 51/102 controls; AG = 84/155 patients vs. 38/102 controls; GG = 21/155 patients vs. 13/102 controls, chi(2) = 8.94, P =.011). This difference was caused by a significant over-representation of the G allele in patients compared to controls (105/155 patients vs. 51/102 controls, chi(2) = 8.34, P =.004, odds ratio = 2.12). The GG genotype was associated with a significantly higher mean serum aspartate transaminase level (P =. 03), greater frequency of antibodies to thyroid microsomal antigens (P =.004) and was found more commonly in patients with HLA DRB1*0301 (P =.02). Treatment outcomes, however, were not affected by the genotype. The CTLA-4 G allele is more common in patients with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis and may represent a second susceptibility allele. Furthermore, there may be synergy between the HLA-DRB1*0301 and the GG genotype in terms of disease risk.\", \"year\": 2000, \"publication\": \"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)\", \"period\": \"2000s\"}, {\"x\": -0.09220646321773529, \"y\": -0.010710729286074638, \"context\": \"of these associations in nonsmokers, women and **diverse** racial populations is warranted. the purpose of this\", \"tokens\": \"of these associations in non ##smo ##kers , women and diverse racial populations is warrant ##ed . the purpose of this\", \"word\": \"diverse\", \"abstract\": \"Previous epidemiologic studies that have examined the relationship between renal cell carcinoma (RCC) risk and intakes of plant foods and antioxidant nutrients have yielded inconsistent results.

At baseline, 27,062 male Finnish smokers aged 50-69 years completed a 276-item dietary questionnaire that included questions on frequency of consumption and portion size. During up to 19 years of follow-up, 255 men developed RCC. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Despite a large range in intake, no association was observed between fruit, vegetables or antioxidant nutrients and RCC risk. For example, multivariate RRs and 95% CIs for the highest versus the lowest quartile of intake were 0.79 (0.55-1.14), 1.23 (0.85-1.79), 1.09 (0.74-1.60), 0.83 (0.57-1.21), 1.09 (0.73-1.64) and 0.99 (0.67-1.46) for fruit, vegetables, total carotenoids, total flavonoids, total vitamin E and vitamin C, respectively (all p values for trend > 0.05).

Raman mapping of the extrudate cores revealed that drug particles of diverse size were dispersed in a continuous lipid phase with or without polyethylene glycol. At the surface, there was evidence of more mixing between the components. Previous characterisation by other methods suggested that the extrudate surface is covered predominantly by lipid, and the Raman mapping suggested that such a layer is in general less than a few micrometres thick. Nevertheless, the lipid layer dramatically reduced the drug dissolution rate. The extrudate cores were also mapped after a period of dissolution testing, and there was no evidence of a uniformly receding drug boundary in the extrudates during drug release. In situ Raman spectroscopy analysis during dissolution testing revealed that the drug distribution in the extrudate affected the formation of theophylline monohydrate.

There were no significant differences in either the intrasulcal length or surface area of the anterior or posterior walls between the 2 groups.

Their answers were compared with those of control subjects from the same neighborhood, matched with the victim according to sex, race, and age range. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated with matched-pairs methods.\\nRESULTS:\\nDuring the study period, 803 suicides occurred in the two counties, 565 of which (70 percent) took place in the home of the victim. Fifty-eight percent (326) of these suicides were committed with a firearm. After excluding 11 case subjects for various reasons, we were able to interview 80 percent (442) of the proxies for the case subjects. Matching controls were identified for 99 percent of these subjects, producing 438 matched pairs. Univariate analyses revealed that the case subjects were more likely than the controls to have lived alone, taken prescribed psychotropic medication, been arrested, abused drugs or alcohol, or not graduated from high school. After we controlled for these characteristics through conditional logistic regression, the presence of one or more guns in the home was found to be associated with an increased risk of suicide (adjusted odds ratio, 4.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 8.5).\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\nReady availability of firearms is associated with an increased risk of suicide in the home. Owners of firearms should weigh their reasons for keeping a gun in the home against the possibility that it might someday be used in a suicide.\\n\", \"year\": 1992, \"publication\": \"The New England journal of medicine\", \"period\": \"1990s\"}, {\"x\": -0.09454087913036346, \"y\": -0.06286492943763733, \"context\": \"d ) is activated in mammalian cells in response to **diverse** stimuli that include growth factors, activators of\", \"tokens\": \"##d ) is activated in mammalian cells in response to diverse stimuli that include growth factors , act ##iva ##tors of\", \"word\": \"diverse\", \"abstract\": \"Phospholipase D (PLD) is activated in mammalian cells in response to diverse stimuli that include growth factors, activators of protein kinase C, and agonists binding to G-protein-coupled receptors.

Twenty prevalence cases of dysplasia in SSBO were detected: 17 low grade dysplasia (LGD), three high grade dysplasia (HGD). Seventy six patients with CIM were identified (mean age 67 years, range 37-81; 81% whites). A single prevalence case of LGD in CIM was detected. During follow up of 78 SSBO and 34 CIM patients, dysplasia developed in nine (seven LGD, two HGD) with SSBO and in one (LGD) with CIM. There were significant differences between the two groups with respect to age, ethnicity, dysplasia prevalence, and incidence. Time to dysplasia progression was significantly longer in CIM compared with SSBO patients. Of the five patients with SSBO and HGD, one developed adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus on follow up. No HGD or cancers have been detected over this time period in CIM patients.\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\nThe dysplasia risk is significantly greater in SSBO than in CIM patients, indicating two potentially different clinical processes.

Clinical stage was determined by retrospective review of the medical records and Gleason score of biopsy material as assigned by a single uropathologist. Of 611 patients who died the cause of death was determined by retrospective or prospective review of hospital records in 493 and by review of the death certificates in 102. In 16 cases the cause of death was indeterminate. Median potential followup was 112 months (range 60 to 182) and median period of observation was 61 months (range 1 to 182).\\nRESULTS:\\nCause specific survival with stage T1b-2 cancer was lower in 231 black than in 264 white men of all ages (p = 0.02) and lower in 110 black than in 170 white men younger than in 70 years at diagnosis (p = 0.04).

No or unknown treatment status, which was associated with a less favorable cause specific survival compared to treatment (p = 0.05), was more common in black than in white men with stage T1b-2 cancer of all ages (p = 0.0005) but not significantly different when stratified by age. In men of all ages racial differences in cause specific survival were not significant when adjusted for age and Gleason score (p = 0.14) or age, Gleason score and treatment status (p = 0.17). In men younger than 70 years racial differences in cause specific survival were not significant when adjusted for age and Gleason score (p = 0.22).

The C5 proteasome subunit-derived RRFFPYYV and RRFFPYYVY peptides are natural B*2705 ligands. The octamer is an allospecific CTL epitope. Digestion of a 27-mer fragment of C5 revealed that both ligands are generated from this precursor substrate with the 20S proteasome in vitro in a ratio comparable to that in the B*2705-bound peptide pool. The C5 sequence allowed to derive a nested set of six additional peptides with 8-11 residues containing the core octamer sequence and the Arg2 motif of HLA-B27, none of which was found in the B27-bound pool. Together, low proteasomal yield, disfavored TAP-binding motifs, and low affinity for B*2705 accounted for the absence of four of the six peptides. The two remaining differed from the natural octamer or nonamer ligands only by an additional N-terminal Ser residue. Their stability in complex with B*2705 was lower than the respective natural ligands, raising the possibility that N-terminal trimming might have favored a shift toward the more stable peptides. The results suggest that the B*2705-bound peptide repertoire has a highly restricted diversity around a core alloantigenic sequence. This is not explained by a single bottleneck feature, but by multiple factors, including proteasomal generation, TAP-binding motifs, MHC-binding efficiency, and perhaps optimized stability through N-terminal trimming.

The most notable oxysterol activities center around the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, which appears to be controlled in part by a complex series of interactions of oxysterol ligands with various receptors, such as the oxysterol binding protein, the cellular nucleic acid binding protein, the sterol regulatory element binding protein, the LXR nuclear orphan receptors, and the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Identification of the endogenous oxysterol ligands and elucidation of their enzymatic origins are topics of active investigation. Except for 24, 25-epoxysterols, most oxysterols arise from cholesterol by autoxidation or by specific microsomal or mitochondrial oxidations, usually involving cytochrome P-450 species. Oxysterols are variously metabolized to esters, bile acids, steroid hormones, cholesterol, or other sterols through pathways that may differ according to the type of cell and mode of experimentation (in vitro, in vivo, cell culture). Reliable measurements of oxysterol levels and activities are hampered by low physiological concentrations (approximately 0.01-0.1 microM plasma) relative to cholesterol (approximately 5,000 microM) and by the susceptibility of cholesterol to autoxidation, which produces artifactual oxysterols that may also have potent activities. Reports describing the occurrence and levels of oxysterols in plasma, low-density lipoproteins, various tissues, and food products include many unrealistic data resulting from inattention to autoxidation and to limitations of the analytical methodology. Because of the widespread lack of appreciation for the technical difficulties involved in oxysterol research, a rigorous evaluation of the chromatographic and spectroscopic methods used in the isolation, characterization, and quantitation of oxysterols has been included.

The influence of these compounds on cytokine production or immune system function remains unclear. In this study we have examined the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and XEs on chemoattractant cytokine (chemokine) production and analyzed the molecular mechanism. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), also termed monocyte chemotactic and activating factor, is a member of the chemokine family and attracts mainly blood monocytes. Human mammary tumor cell line MCF-7 cells produce a large quantity of MCP-1 in response to interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha). Addition of E2 to MCF-7 cells inhibited MCP-1 production in a dose-dependent manner. XEs, bisphenol A, and NP also inhibited MCP-1 production, although the potency was 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than that of E2. E2, bisphenol A, and NP inhibited MCP-1 messenger RNA expression in MCF-7 cells. Two closely located nuclear factor-kappaB sites, A1 and A2, have been identified in the promoter of the human MCP-1 gene. A luciferase construct containing this enhancer region (pGLM-ENH) was activated by IL-1alpha, and a mutation at either the A1 or A2 site resulted in a loss of IL-1alpha responsiveness. Treatment with E2 or XEs decreased the IL-1alpha-inducible pGLM-ENH luciferase activity significantly. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift analysis, we found that treatment with E2 or XEs diminished the IL-1alpha-induced complex formation with both A1 and A2 probes, which was identified immunochemically to consist of nuclear factor-kappaB, p50, and p65. The IL-1alpha-induced p50/c-Rel complex to the A2 probe was also, to a lesser extent, decreased by E2 or XE treatment. The effects of E2 and XEs on the expression of MCP-1 seem to be much more dramatic than the effects of these agents on the promoters used in the luciferase assay, suggesting the involvement of an additional site(s) of the promoter region of the MCP-1 gene or posttranscriptional regulation of MCP-1 gene expression by E2 and XEs.

Unfortunately, the focus on reliability came at a time when the scientific understanding of mental disorders was embryonic and could not yield valid disease definitions. Based on accreting problems with the current DSM-fourth edition (DSM-IV) classification, it is apparent that validity will not be achieved simply by refining criteria for existing disorders or by the addition of new disorders. Yet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria dominate thinking about mental disorders in clinical practice, research, treatment development, and law.

Moreover, it seems that clozapine, risperidone and haloperidol treatment due to antiaggregatory action may have even some antithrombotic effects.\\n\", \"year\": 2010, \"publication\": \"The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry\", \"period\": \"2010s\"}, {\"x\": -0.09523360431194305, \"y\": -0.019817955791950226, \"context\": \", suggesting an intrauterine origin. differences in **diversity** were detected in infants whose mothers intended to breast feed\", \"tokens\": \", suggesting an intra ##uter ##ine origin . differences in diversity were detected in infants whose mothers intended to breast feed\", \"word\": \"diversity\", \"abstract\": \"OBJECTIVE:\\nTo use high throughput techniques to analyze intestinal microbial ecology in premature neonates, who are highly susceptible to perturbations of the luminal environment associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis.\\nMETHODS:\\nWith non-culture-based techniques, we evaluated intestinal microbiota shortly after birth and during hospitalization in 23 neonates born at 23 to 32 weeks gestational age.

The intrasulcal length, surface area, and local variability of the CS were measured. There were no significant differences in either the intrasulcal length or surface area of the anterior or posterior walls between the 2 groups.

Importantly, we found that the musicians showed greater local variability in the middle section (i.e., somatotopic hand area) of the right CS and the lower section of the left CS as compared with the controls. Further analysis revealed significantly negative correlations between the variability of the middle section of the right CS and the age of commencement of musical training. Our findings suggest that the musicians might be associated with plastic changes in the 3D morphology of the CS in response to long-term motor skill training.\", \"year\": 2010, \"publication\": \"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)\", \"period\": \"2010s\"}, {\"x\": -0.07331641018390656, \"y\": 0.11542816460132599, \"context\": \"20 ). however, when stratified for **ethnicity**, there may be an increased risk for fatal outcomes\", \"tokens\": \"20 ) . however , when st ##rat ##ified for ethnicity , there may be an increased risk for fatal outcomes\", \"word\": \"ethnicity\", \"abstract\": \"OBJECTIVE:\\nThe tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha promoter -308 A/G polymorphism has been reported to be associated with sepsis with inconsistent results.
