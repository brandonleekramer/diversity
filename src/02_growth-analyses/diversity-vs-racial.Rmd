One particularly important observation is that diversity began to outpace race/ethnicity after 2012. Berrey (2015) suggests that the lens of diversity might actually provide a mechanism to mask explicit focus on racial/ethnic inequities. To test this, we compared how often 

```{r}
div_race_comp <- general_pop_terms %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise(sum_diversity = sum(di_diversity),
            sum_racial = sum(di_racial),
            sum_sexgender = sum(di_sexgender)) %>% 
  left_join(biomed_text_data, by = "id") %>% 
  filter(sum_diversity != 0 | sum_racial != 0) %>% 
  select(id, sum_diversity, sum_racial, abstract)

# 3500 abstract that use diversity or racial/ethnic
div_race_comp %>%  
  filter(sum_diversity != 0 & sum_racial != 0) %>% 
  # 202 where they are used together
  unnest_tokens(word, abstract) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  anti_join(my_stopwords) %>% 
  count(word) %>% arrange(-n)
  
div_race_comp %>% 
  filter(sum_racial == 0) %>%  
  # 2,317 where diversity is used but not race 
  unnest_tokens(word, abstract) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  anti_join(my_stopwords) %>% 
  count(word) %>% arrange(-n)

div_race_comp %>%  
  filter(sum_diversity == 0) %>% 
  # 981 where race is used but not diversity
  unnest_tokens(word, abstract) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  anti_join(my_stopwords) %>% 
  count(word) %>% arrange(-n)

# set a seed so that the output of the model is predictable
ap_lda <- LDA(AssociatedPress, k = 2, control = list(seed = 1234))
ap_lda
