<p>Finally, to test Hypothesis 4, we evaluated the geographical basis of population terminology use and variation in US-specific racial and ethnic categories over time. We did in two steps. First, we extracted and parsed all of the address information of authors in our diversity corpus, recoding these data into ISO Alpha-2 country codes. We then examined how often all population terms (i.e.Â our dictionary of 2,200+ terms) were used from researchers in each country.</p>

<p>Figure 4A shows the use of population terms by researchers in the top-5 countries of our dataset (i.e.Â the US, the UK, China, Germany and Australia). Not surprisingly, US-based scholars are by far the most avid users of population terminology, having a total that sums to nearly five times more than UK or Chinese-based scholars. In fact, it seems that there has been almost no increase in the use of population terms outside of the US and UK until after 2010.</p>

<p>While the proportions in Figure 4B are relatively stable for the other four countries, the US exhibits nearly a 5% increase from 1993 to 1996, which is shortly after the NIH Revitalization Act was instituted in 1993 (Epstein 2007). The only other somewhat surprising result in this figure is that, like some of our results above, we actually see a decline in the use of population terminology among US-based scholars from 2006 to 2017. To find out more about what might explain these declining trends, we explored the use of US-specific terminology.</p>
<p>Next, to further test Hypothesis 4, we looked at US-specific population terminology, including the umbrella categorizations of Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islander, race, and ethnicity (Figures 4A-4B). While single words were extracted using tidytextâs tokenization process, we also extracted bigrams (i.e.Â unique two-word combinations that arise in the corpus) for terms like African American, Native American, Pacific Islander, or the various Asian American groups listed on the US Census (2018) website. In turn, these bigrams were subsequently added back into the original US-specific classifications. For example, terms like African American and Afro American were both re-coded as âBlackâ while terms like Asian American or Thai American were coded as âAsian.â</p>

<p>Figure 4C shows the growth trends in US-specific terminology as based on the vernacular used on the US-Census and OMB Directive 15. Here, we find that almost all of these terms did marginally increase in usage from 1990-2004. However, from 2005-2012, the use of these terms stabilizes and, in some cases, even decreases before another spike after 2014. The most robust growth trend occurs for ethnicity while race is the second highest. Somewhat surprisingly, the term Asian has a higher usage rate than both white and black while Hispanic/Latino, Native American and Pacific Islander have all stayed about the same since the mid-2000s.</p>

<p>Finally, Figure 4D demonstrates the same non-linear trend discussed in our discussion of Hypothesis 1. Most prominently, the term ethnicity rises sharply from 1993 to 1996, climbs more slowly in the next decade, and then drops back to about 2% of all published abstracts in the sample. In general, all the other terms in this graph (i.e.Â Asian, Black, white, Hispanic/Latinx, race and ethnicity) follow the same parabolic curve with the exception of Pacific-Islander and Native-American, which show almost no variance over the entirety of the sampling period.</p>

<h3>Main Takeaway</h3>
<p>Overall, Figures 4A-4C support our hypothesis that <em>(a)</em> US-based researchers tend to use population terminology at disproportionately higher rates than scientists from other countries and <em>(b)</em> that terminology based on the US-Census and OMB Directive 15 have increased since 1990. However, when looking more closely at these trends, we also find that the use of US-specific terminology has marginally decreased since 2005 - once again suggesting that biomedical scientists seem to have abandoned the use of race and ethnicity in exchange for geographic terminology to enact population differences in their research.</p>
