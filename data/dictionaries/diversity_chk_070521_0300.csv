32907902,"objective:
the purpose of this study is to examine workplace violence (wpv) towards healthcare professionals in a multiethnic area in china, including prevalence, influencing factors, healthcare professionals' response to wpv, expected antiviolence training measures and content, and evaluation of wpv interventions.
design:
a cross-sectional study.
setting:
a grade iii, class a hospital in the capital of yunnan province, which is the province with the most diverse ethnic minority groups in china.
participants:
in total, 2036 healthcare professionals participated, with a response rate of 83.79%.
results:
the prevalence of physical and psychological violence was 5.5% and 43.7%, respectively. healthcare professionals of ethnic minority were more likely to experience psychological violence (or=1.54, 95% ci 1.16 to 2.05). stratified by gender, male healthcare professionals of ethnic minority suffered from more physical violence (or=3.31, 95% ci 1.12 to 9.79), while female healthcare professionals suffered from psychological violence (or=1.71, 95% ci 1.24 to 2.36). we also found a unique work situation in china: overtime duty on-call work (18:00-07:00) was a risk factor for psychological violence (or=1.40, 95% ci 1.02 to 1.93). healthcare professionals of ethnic minority are less likely to order perpetrators to stop or to report to superiors when faced with psychological violence. they are also more interested in receiving training in force skills and self-defence. both han and ethnic minority participants considered security measures as the most useful intervention, while changing the time of shift the most useless one.
conclusion:
our study comprehensively described wpv towards healthcare professionals in a multiethnic minority area. more research on wpv conducted in multiethnic areas is needed.

24465513,"the hiv epidemic is primarily characterised by the circulation of hiv-1 group m (main) comprising of 11 subtypes and sub-subtypes (a1, a2, b-d, f1, f2, g, h, j, and k) and to date 55 circulating recombinant forms (crfs). in southeast asia, active inter-subtype recombination involving three main circulating genotypes--subtype b (including subtype b', the thai variant of subtype b), crf01_ae, and crf33_01b--have contributed to the emergence of novel unique recombinant forms. in the present study, we conducted the molecular epidemiological surveillance of hiv-1 gag-rt genes among 258 people who inject drugs (pwids) in kuala lumpur, malaysia, between 2009 and 2011 whereby a novel crf candidate was recently identified. the near full-length genome sequences obtained from six epidemiologically unlinked individuals showed identical mosaic structures consisting of subtype b' and crf01_ae, with six unique recombination breakpoints in the gag-rt, pol, and env regions. among the high-risk population of pwids in malaysia, which was predominantly infected by crf33_01b (>70%), crf58_01b circulated at a low but significant prevalence (2.3%, 6/258). interestingly, the crf58_01b shared two unique recombination breakpoints with other established crfs in the region: crf33_01b, crf48_01b, and crf53_01b in the gag gene, and crf15_01b (from thailand) in the env gene. extended bayesian markov chain monte carlo sampling analysis showed that crf58_01b and other recently discovered crfs were most likely to have originated in malaysia, and that the recent spread of recombinant lineages in the country had little influence from neighbouring countries. the isolation, genetic characterization, and evolutionary features of crf58_01b among pwids in malaysia signify the increasingly complex hiv-1 diversity in southeast asia that may hold an implication on disease treatment, control, and prevention.",1,1,0
28640092,"this study investigated the relationships between the area and metabolic activity of adipose tissue and the presence of colorectal adenoma (cra). our institutional review board approved the study and waived informed consent. a total of 212 subjects who underwent fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg) positron emission tomography (pet)/computed tomography (ct) and colonoscopy for routine health check-ups were enrolled. the volumetric parameters of areas of visceral (vatav), subcutaneous (satav), and total adipose tissue (tatav) and calculated visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio (vsr) and visceral-to-total adipose tissue ratio (var) were considered. metabolic parameters of standardized uptake value (suv) of visceral (vcsuvmax, vcsuvmean), subcutaneous (scsuvmax, scsuvmean), and calculated visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio (vsrmax, vsrmean) were considered. anthropometric data of height, weight, body mass index (bmi), waist circumference (wc), body fat mass (bfm), skeletal muscle mass (smm), and diverse laboratory data were also considered as variables. sixty-six subjects were placed in the cra group and 146 subjects in the non-cra group. the presence of cra was significantly correlated with older age (p  =  .001), male sex (p  =  .041), higher bmi (p  =  .004), higher wc (p  =  .001), higher bfm (p  =  .024), higher vatav (p < .001), higher tatav (p  =  .004), higher vsr (p < .001), higher var (p < .001), lower vcsuvmax (p  =  .002), lower vcsuvmean (p < .001), and lower vsrmean (p  =  .002). on multiple regression analysis, vcsuvmax and vcsuvmean were independently associated with the presence of cra (p  =  .009 and p  =  .045). lower glucose metabolism of visceral adipose tissue was related to the presence of cra. our findings identify the value of visceral metabolic dysfunction as a potential surrogate marker of elevated risk for cra.",1,3,0
8978036,"the a mating type locus of coprinus cinereus is remarkable for its extreme diversity, with over 100 different alleles in natural populations. classical genetic studies have demonstrated that this hypervariability arises in part from recombination between two subloci of a, alpha and beta, although more recent population genetic data have indicated a third segregating sublocus. in this study, we characterized the molecular basis by which recombination generates nonparental a mating types. we mapped the frequency and location of all recombination events in two crosses and correlated the genetic and physical maps of a. we found that all recombination events were located in 6 kb of noncoding dna between the alpha and beta subloci and that the rate of recombination in this noncoding region matched that generally observed for this genome. no recombination within gene clusters or within coding regions was observed, and the two alpha and beta subloci described in genetic analyses correlated with the previously characterized alpha and beta gene clusters. we propose that pairs of genes constitute both the sex determining and the hereditary unit of a.",1,0,0

to explore how e-cigarettes are being promoted at point of sale in the uk and how retailers perceive market trends.
methods:
fixed retail outlets subject to a ban on the display of tobacco products.
methods:
observational audit of all stores selling tobacco products (n=96) in 4 scottish communities, conducted over 2 waves 12 months apart (2013-2014), and qualitative interviews with small retailers (n=25) in 4 matched communities.
methods:
the audit measured e-cigarette display characteristics, advertising materials and proximity to other products, and differences by area-level disadvantage. interviews explored retailers' perceptions of e-cigarette market opportunities and risks, and customer responses.
results:
the number of e-cigarette point-of-sale display units and number of brands displayed increased between waves. e-cigarettes were displayed close to products of interest to children in 36% of stores. stores in more affluent areas were less likely to have external e-cigarette advertising than those in deprived areas. although e-cigarettes delivered high profit margins, retailers were confused by the diversity of brands and products, and uncertain of the sector's viability. some customers were perceived to purchase e-cigarettes as cessation aids, and others, particularly low-income smokers, as a cheaper adjunct to conventional tobacco.
conclusions:
e-cigarette point-of-sale displays and number of brands displayed increased over 12 months, a potential cause for concern given their lack of regulation. further scrutiny is needed of the content and effects of such advertising, and the potentially normalising effects of placing e-cigarettes next to products of interest to children.

2182763,"the epidermis of clinically normal-appearing human skin harbors a phenotypically heterogeneous population of t lymphocytes (tcs), the majority of which are cd2+/cd3+/cd5+ ""memory"" cells, but in an unactivated state, and express the tcr-alpha/beta. in contrast to murine skin, only a very minor subpopulation of cd3+ cells in the human epidermis bears the tcr-gamma/delta. epidermal tcs primarily are distributed along the rete ridges in the basal keratinocyte layer and are often in close apposition to langerhans cells (lcs). these tcs were propagated from epidermal cell suspensions after stimulation with tc activating agents (con a, ril-1, ril-2), then evaluated for phenotypic features and tcr diversity. similar to the in situ situation, most were cd4-/cd8+/tcr-alpha/beta+. in addition, two cultures contained tcr-gamma/delta+ cells; one of these determined to be an adherent cd4-/cd8+ population. epidermal tcs were significantly (p less than 0.0001) more abundant in the sole than in the other body regions examined (i.e., 40 vs. 7 cd3+ cells/linear centimeter of epidermis) and seemed to have a particular affinity for the acrosyringial epithelium of eccrine sweat ducts. moreover, the sole usually contained a greater number of cd8+ relative to cd4+ tcs, whereas the epidermal cd4/cd8 ratio in the trunk and extremities was quite variable, although the trend also was towards a slightly larger percentage of cd8+ cells. collectively, our data suggest that the volar epidermis has a unique microenvironment which is responsible for both the higher density of tcs, preferentially cd8+, and lower number of lcs. this study has not only provided evidence for significant regional variability in the human epidermal tc population of normal skin, but also strengthens the concept for skin-associated lymphoid tissues (salt), whereby memory tcs recirculate back to the epidermis and interact with resident antigen-presenting cells (i.e., lc).",1,3,0

genetic diversity of non-model organisms offers a repertoire of unique phenotypic features for exploration and cultivation for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications. to realize this enormous potential, it is critical to have an efficient genome editing tool for rapid strain engineering of these organisms to perform novel programmed functions.
results:
to accommodate the use of crispr/cas systems for genome editing across organisms, we have developed a novel method, named crispr associated software for pathway engineering and research (casper), for identifying on- and off-targets with enhanced predictability coupled with an analysis of non-unique (repeated) targets to assist in editing any organism with various endonucleases. utilizing casper, we demonstrated a modest 2.4% and significant 30.2% improvement (f-test, p < 0.05) over the conventional methods for predicting on- and off-target activities, respectively. further we used casper to develop novel applications in genome editing: multitargeting analysis (i.e. simultaneous multiple-site modification on a target genome with a sole guide-rna requirement) and multispecies population analysis (i.e. guide-rna design for genome editing across a consortium of organisms). our analysis on a selection of industrially relevant organisms revealed a number of non-unique target sites associated with genes and transposable elements that can be used as potential sites for multitargeting. the analysis also identified shared and unshared targets that enable genome editing of single or multiple genomes in a consortium of interest. we envision casper as a useful platform to enhance the precise crispr genome editing for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications.

the present study examined whether adolescents' initial consequences of sexual activity differ according to type of sexual activity and gender.
methods:
surveys were administered to 618 adolescents recruited from 2 public high schools in the autumn of ninth grade (2002) and at 6-month intervals until the spring of tenth grade (2004). analyses were limited to the 275 adolescents (44%) who reported engaging in oral sex and/or vaginal sex at any assessment. participants were 14 years of age at study entry, 56% female, and of diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds.
results:
in comparison with adolescents who engaged in oral sex and/or vaginal sex, adolescents who engaged only in oral sex were less likely to report experiencing a pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection, feeling guilty or used, having their relationship become worse, and getting into trouble with their parents as a result of sex. adolescents who engaged only in oral sex were also less likely to report experiencing pleasure, feeling good about themselves, and having their relationship become better as a result of sex. boys were more likely than girls to report feeling good about themselves, experiencing popularity, and experiencing a pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection as a result of sex, whereas girls were more likely than boys to report feeling bad about themselves and feeling used.
conclusions:
adolescents experience a range of social and emotional consequences after having sex. our findings have implications for clinical practice and public health campaigns targeted toward youth.

to evaluate preferences for and experiences with genetic testing in a diverse cohort of patients with breast cancer identified through population-based registries, with attention to differences by race/ethnicity.
methods:
we surveyed women diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer from 2005 to 2007, as reported to the seer registries of metropolitan los angeles and detroit, about experiences with hereditary risk evaluation. multivariable models evaluated correlates of a strong desire for genetic testing, unmet need for discussion with a health care professional, and receipt of testing.
results:
among 1,536 patients who completed the survey, 35% expressed strong desire for genetic testing, 28% reported discussing testing with a health care professional, and 19% reported test receipt. strong desire for testing was more common in younger women, latinas, and those with family history. minority patients were significantly more likely to have unmet need for discussion (failure to discuss genetic testing with a health professional when they had a strong desire for testing): odds ratios of 1.68, 2.44, and 7.39 for blacks, english-speaking latinas, and spanish-speaking latinas compared with whites, respectively. worry in the long-term survivorship period was higher among those with unmet need for discussion (48.7% v 24.9%; p <.001). patients who received genetic testing were younger, less likely to be black, and more likely to have a family cancer history.
conclusions:
many patients, especially minorities, express a strong desire for genetic testing and may benefit from discussion to clarify risks. clinicians should discuss genetic risk even with patients they perceive to be at low risk, as this may reduce worry.

25437428,"huanglongbing (hlb), also known as citrus greening, is one of the most destructive diseases of citrus worldwide. hlb is associated with three species of 'candidatus liberibacter' with 'ca. l. asiaticus' (las) being the most widely distributed around the world, and the only species detected in thailand. to understand the genetic diversity of las bacteria in thailand, we evaluated two closely-related effector genes, lasai and lasaii, found within the las prophages from 239 infected citrus and 55 infected psyllid samples collected from different provinces in thailand. the results indicated that most of the las-infected samples collected from thailand contained at least one prophage sequence with 48.29% containing prophage 1 (fp1), 63.26% containing prophage 2 (fp2), and 19.38% containing both prophages. interestingly, fp2 was found to be the predominant population in las-infected citrus samples while las-infected psyllids contained primarily fp1. the multiple banding patterns that resulted from amplification of lasai imply extensive variation exists within the full and partial repeat sequence while the single band from lasaii indicates a low amount of variation within the repeat sequence. phylogenetic analysis of las-infected samples from 22 provinces in thailand suggested that the bacterial pathogen may have been introduced to thailand from china and the philippines. this is the first report evaluating the genetic variation of a large population of ca. l. asiaticus infected samples in thailand using the two effector genes from las prophage regions.

28025204,"motivation:
genetic variation in human populations is influenced by geographic ancestry due to spatial locality in historical mating and migration patterns. spatial population structure in genetic datasets has been traditionally analyzed using either model-free algorithms, such as principal components analysis (pca) and multidimensional scaling, or using explicit spatial probabilistic models of allele frequency evolution. we develop a general probabilistic model and an associated inference algorithm that unify the model-based and data-driven approaches to visualizing and inferring population structure. our spatial inference algorithm can also be effectively applied to the problem of population stratification in genome-wide association studies (gwas), where hidden population structure can create fictitious associations when population ancestry is correlated with both the genotype and the trait.
results:
our algorithm geographic ancestry positioning (gap) relates local genetic distances between samples to their spatial distances, and can be used for visually discerning population structure as well as accurately inferring the spatial origin of individuals on a two-dimensional continuum. on both simulated and several real datasets from diverse human populations, gap exhibits substantially lower error in reconstructing spatial ancestry coordinates compared to pca. we also develop an association test that uses the ancestry coordinates inferred by gap to accurately account for ancestry-induced correlations in gwas. based on simulations and analysis of a dataset of 10 metabolic traits measured in a northern finland cohort, which is known to exhibit significant population structure, we find that our method has superior power to current approaches.

live attenuated influenza vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce influenza in diverse populations of children, but no efficacy studies have been done in resource-poor tropical settings. in senegal, we assessed the efficacy and safety of a live attenuated influenza vaccine based on russian-derived master donor viruses and licensed as a single dose.
methods:
in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single-centre trial done near niakhar, senegal, generally healthy children aged 2-5 years were randomly allocated (2:1) to receive a single intranasal dose of masked trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine or placebo. the allocation sequence was computer-generated by path with block sizes of three. the manufacturer provided vaccine and placebo in coded vials to preserve blinding. participants were monitored through the predictable influenza season in senegal for adverse events and signs and symptoms of influenza using weekly home visits and surveillance in clinics. the primary outcome was symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza caused by any strain and occurring from 15 days post-vaccination to the end of the study. the primary analysis was per protocol. this study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number nct01854632.
findings:
between may 23, and july 1, 2013, 1761 children were randomly assigned, 1174 to receive live attenuated influenza vaccine and 587 to receive placebo. the per-protocol set included 1173 vaccinees and 584 placebo recipients followed up to dec 20, 2013. symptomatic influenza was laboratory-confirmed in 210 (18%) of 1173 recipients of live attenuated influenza vaccine and 105 (18%) of placebo recipients, giving a vaccine efficacy of 0·0% (95% ci -26·4 to 20·9). adverse events were balanced between the study groups. two girls who had received live attenuated influenza vaccine died, one due to anasarca 12 days postvaccination and one due to malnutrition 70 days postvaccination.
interpretation:
live attenuated influenza vaccine was well tolerated in young children in senegal, but did not provide protection against influenza. further study in such populations, which might experience extended periods of influenza circulation, is warranted.

current tobacco use treatment approaches require smokers to request treatment or depend on the provider to initiate smoking cessation care and are therefore reactive. most smokers do not receive evidence-based treatments for tobacco use that include both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy.
objective:
to assess the effect of a proactive, population-based tobacco cessation care model on use of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments and on population-level smoking cessation rates (ie, abstinence among all smokers including those who use and do not use treatment) compared with usual care among a diverse population of current smokers.
methods:
the veterans victory over tobacco study, a pragmatic randomized clinical trial involving a population-based registry of current smokers aged 18 to 80 years. a total of 6400 current smokers, identified using the department of veterans affairs (va) electronic medical record, were randomized prior to contact to evaluate both the reach and effectiveness of the proactive care intervention.
methods:
current smokers were randomized to usual care or proactive care. proactive care combined (1) proactive outreach and (2) offer of choice of smoking cessation services (telephone or in-person). proactive outreach included mailed invitations followed by telephone outreach to motivate smokers to seek treatment with choice of services.
methods:
the primary outcome was 6-month prolonged smoking abstinence at 1 year and was assessed by a follow-up survey among all current smokers regardless of interest in quitting or treatment utilization.
results:
a total of 5123 participants were included in the primary analysis. the follow-up survey response rate was 66%. the population-level, 6-month prolonged smoking abstinence rate at 1 year was 13.5% for proactive care compared with 10.9% for usual care (p = .02). logistic regression mixed model analysis showed a significant effect of the proactive care intervention on 6-month prolonged abstinence (odds ratio [or], 1.27 [95% ci, 1.03-1.57]). in analyses accounting for nonresponse using likelihood-based not-missing-at-random models, the effect of proactive care on 6-month prolonged abstinence persisted (or, 1.33 [95% ci, 1.17-1.51]).
conclusions:
proactive, population-based tobacco cessation care using proactive outreach to connect smokers to evidence-based telephone or in-person smoking cessation services is effective for increasing long-term population-level cessation rates.

27050151,"emerging biological and translational insights from large sequencing efforts underscore the need for genetically-relevant cell lines to study the relationships between genomic alterations of tumors, and therapeutic dependencies. here, we report a detailed characterization of a novel panel of clinically annotated oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) cell lines, derived from patients with diverse ethnicity and risk habits. molecular analysis by rnaseq and copy number alterations (cna) identified that the cell lines harbour cna that have been previously reported in oscc, for example focal amplications in 3q, 7p, 8q, 11q, 20q and deletions in 3p, 5q, 8p, 18q. similarly, our analysis identified the same cohort of frequently mutated genes previously reported in oscc including tp53, cdkn2a, epha2, fat1, notch1, casp8 and pik3ca. notably, we identified mutations (mll4, usp9x, arid2) in cell lines derived from betel quid users that may be associated with this specific risk factor. gene expression profiles of the orl lines also aligned with those reported for oscc. by focusing on those gene expression signatures that are predictive of chemotherapeutic response, we observed that the orl lines broadly clustered into three groups (cell cycle, xenobiotic metabolism, others). the orl lines noted to be enriched in cell cycle genes responded preferentially to the cdk1 inhibitor ro3306, by mtt cell viability assay. overall, our in-depth characterization of clinically annotated orl lines provides new insight into the molecular alterations synonymous with oscc, which can facilitate in the identification of biomarkers that can be used to guide diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of oscc.

25593593,"genome-wide association studies (gwass) have become an increasingly important approach for eukaryotic geneticists, facilitating the identification of hundreds of genetic polymorphisms that are responsible for inherited diseases. despite the relative simplicity of bacterial genomes, the application of gwass to identify polymorphisms responsible for important bacterial phenotypes has only recently been made possible through advances in genome sequencing technologies. bacterial gwass are now about to come of age thanks to the availability of massive datasets, and because of the potential to bridge genomics and traditional genetic approaches that is provided by improving validation strategies. a small number of pioneering gwass in bacteria have been published in the past 2 years, examining from 75 to more than 3,000 strains. the experimental designs have been diverse, taking advantage of different processes in bacteria for generating variation. analysis of data from bacterial gwass can, to some extent, be performed using software developed for eukaryotic systems, but there are important differences in genome evolution that must be considered. the greatest experimental advantage of bacterial gwass is the potential to perform downstream validation of causality and dissection of mechanism. we review the recent advances and remaining challenges in this field and propose strategies to improve the validation of bacterial gwass.

29515506,"this paper examines the possible relationship between proposed social determinants of morphological 'complexity' and how this contributes to linguistic diversity, specifically via the typological nature of the sign languages of deaf communities. we sketch how the notion of morphological complexity, as defined by trudgill (2011), applies to sign languages. using these criteria, sign languages appear to be languages with low to moderate levels of morphological complexity. this may partly reflect the influence of key social characteristics of communities on the typological nature of languages. although many deaf communities are relatively small and may involve dense social networks (both social characteristics that trudgill claimed may lend themselves to morphological 'complexification'), the picture is complicated by the highly variable nature of the sign language acquisition for most deaf people, and the ongoing contact between native signers, hearing non-native signers, and those deaf individuals who only acquire sign languages in later childhood and early adulthood. these are all factors that may work against the emergence of morphological complexification. the relationship between linguistic typology and these key social factors may lead to a better understanding of the nature of sign language grammar. this perspective stands in contrast to other work where sign languages are sometimes presented as having complex morphology despite being young languages (e.g., aronoff et al., 2005); in some descriptions, the social determinants of morphological complexity have not received much attention, nor has the notion of complexity itself been specifically explored.",1,1,0

32142725,"objective:
to present a comprehensive report regarding our experience with single-port robotic surgery in our first 100 consecutive patients. we describe the diversity of procedures that can be performed with this platform as well as the challenges and complications we had with the application of this novel technology.
methods:
between september 2018 and august 2019, data on 100 patients who underwent single-port robotic surgery were consecutively collected. preoperative, intraoperative and early postoperative outcomes after various urologic procedures were recorded and analyzed.
results:
during the study period, 100 patients (age [range] 35-84 years; 88 [88%] male) underwent various single-port robotic surgeries for different indications (retroperitoneal [n = 14], pelvic surgeries [n = 86]). transperitoneal (n = 37), extraperitoneal (n = 53) and transvesical (n = 10) approaches have been used to access the target organs. of these procedures, 73 (73%) were for different oncological indications: radical prostatectomy (n = 60), partial nephrectomy (n = 6), retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (n = 1) and radical cystectomy with intracorporeal diversion (n = 6). surgery was successfully completed in all but 1 patient, in whom the surgery was converted to open surgery due to dense adhesions and failure to progress. grades ii-iii postoperative complications were detected in (n = 9) patients.
conclusions:
the purpose-built single-port robotic platform can be safely incorporated into the minimally invasive armamentarium. a wide range of pelvic and retroperitoneal urological procedures can be done with different approaches using this platform. randomized trials with adequate sample size and postoperative follow up period is advisable for further evaluation of the outcomes and to determine the added value of this emerging technology.
