25863819,2015,"This study examinedrisk and resilience factors associated with posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS) in an ethno-racially diverse sample of Hawai׳i National Guard members comprised of Native Hawaiians, Filipino Americans, Japanese Americans, and European Americans. In the full sample, identifying as Japanese American and higher scores on measures of perceived social support and psychological resilience were negatively associated with PTSS, while Army Guard (vs. Air Guard) status and stronger family norms against disclosing mental health problems were positively associated with PTSS. Exploratory analyses of ethno-racial subgroups identified different patterns of within and between-group correlates of PTSS. For example, when controlling for other factors, higher psychological resilience scores were negatively associated with PTSS only among Native Hawaiian and European Americans. Overall, results of this study suggest that some risk and resilience factors associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may extend to military populations with high numbers of Filipino American, Japanese American, and Native Hawaiian Veterans. Results further suggest differences in risk and resilience factors unique to specific ethno-racial subgroups. ",1,1,4,6,20
24116118,2013,"BACKGROUND:
The yersiniae (Enterobacteriaceae) occupy a variety of niches, including some in human and flea hosts. Metabolic adaptations of the yersiniae, which contribute to their success in these specialized environments, remain largely unknown. We report results of an investigation of the transcriptome under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for Y. intermedia, a non-pathogenic member of the genus that has been used as a research surrogate for Y. pestis. Y. intermedia shares characteristics of pathogenic yersiniae, but is not known to cause disease in humans. Oxygen restriction is an important environmental stimulus experienced by many bacteria during their life-cycles and greatly influences their survival in specific environments. How oxygen availability affects physiology in the yersiniae is of importance in their life cycles but has not been extensively characterized.
RESULTS:
Tiled oligonucleotide arrays based on a draft genome sequence of Y. intermedia were used in transcript profiling experiments to identify genes that change expression in response to oxygen availability during growth in minimal media with glucose. The expression of more than 400 genes, constituting about 10% of the genome, was significantly altered due to oxygen-limitation in early log phase under these conditions. Broad functional categorization indicated that, in addition to genes involved in central metabolism, genes involved in adaptation to stress and genes likely involved with host interactions were affected by oxygen-availability. Notable among these, were genes encoding functions for motility, chemotaxis and biosynthesis of cobalamin, which were up-regulated and those for iron/heme utilization, methionine metabolism and urease, which were down-regulated.
CONCLUSIONS:
This is the first transcriptome analysis of a non-pathogenic Yersinia spp. and one of few elucidating the global response to oxygen limitation for any of the yersiniae. Thus this study lays the foundation for further experimental characterization of oxygen-responsive genes and pathways in this ecologically diverse genus.

31432508,2019,"Dysregulation of the epigenetic status of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been linked to diverse human diseases including human cancers. However, the landscape of the whole-genome methylation profile of lncRNAs and the precise roles of these lncRNAs remain elusive in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We first examined lncRNA expression profiles in RCC tissues and corresponding adjacent normal tissues (NTs) to identify the lncRNA signature of RCC, then lncRNA Promoter Microarray was performed to depict the whole-genome methylation profile of lncRNAs in RCC. Combined analysis of the lncRNAs expression profiles and lncRNAs Promoter Microarray identified a series of downregulated lncRNAs with hypermethylated promoter regions, including NR_023387. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) implied that NR_023387 was significantly downregulated in RCC tissues and cell lines, and lower expression of NR_023387 was correlated with shorter overall survival. Methylation-specific PCR, MassARRAY, and demethylation drug treatment indicated that hypermethylation in the NR_023387 promoter contributed to its silencing in RCC. Besides, HNF4A regulated the expression of NR_023387 via transcriptional activation. Functional experiments demonstrated NR_023387 exerted tumor-suppressive roles in RCC via suppressing the proliferation, migration, invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis of RCC. Furthermore, we identified MGP as a putative downstream molecule of NR_023387, which promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of RCC cells. Our study provides the first whole-genome lncRNA methylation profile in RCC. Our combined analysis identifies a tumor-suppressive and prognosis-related lncRNA NR_023387, which is silenced in RCC via promoter hypermethylation and HNF4A deficiency, and may exert its tumor-suppressive roles by downregulating the oncogenic MGP.",1,0,1,0,0

In this sense, the genome sequence elucidation and comparison between strains may lead to disease understanding. Here, two new T. cruzi strains, have been sequenced, Y using Illumina and Bug2148 using PacBio, assembled, analyzed and compared with the T. cruzi annotated genomes available to date. The assembly stats from the new sequences show effective improvement of T. cruzi genome over the actual ones. Such as, the largest contig assembled (1.3 Mb in Bug2148) in de novo attempts and the highest mean assembly coverage (71X for Y). Our analysis reveals a new genomic expansion and greater complexity for those multi-copy gene families related to infection process and disease development, such as Trans-sialidases, Mucins and Mucin Associated Surface Proteins, among others. On one side, we demonstrate that multi-copy gene families are located near telomeric regions of the ""chromosome-like"" 1.3 Mb contig assembled of Bug2148, where they likely suffer high evolutive pressure. On the other hand, we identified several strain-specific single copy genes that might help to understand the differences in infectivity and physiology among strains. In summary, our results indicate that T. cruzi has a complex genomic architecture that may have promoted its evolution.",1,0,1,0,0
24748395,2014,"BACKGROUND:
Recent multi-centre trials showed that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was as efficacious and safe as artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for treatment of young children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria across diverse transmission settings in Africa. Longitudinal follow-up of patients in these trials supported previous findings that DP had a longer post-treatment prophylactic effect than AL, reducing the risk of reinfection and conferring additional health benefits to patients, particularly in areas with moderate to high malaria transmission.
METHODS:
We developed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of DP versus AL for first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria in young children from the provider perspective, taking into consideration the post-treatment prophylactic effects of the drugs as reported by a recent multi-centre trial in Africa and using the maximum manufacturer drug prices for artemisinin-based combination therapies set by the Global Fund in 2013. We estimated the price per course of treatment threshold above which DP would cease to be a cost-saving alternative to AL as a first-line antimalarial drug.
RESULTS:
First-line treatment with DP compared to AL averted 0.03 DALYs (95% CI: 0.006-0.07) and 0.001 deaths (95% CI: 0.00-0.002) and saved $0.96 (95% CI: 0.33-2.46) per child over one year. The results of the threshold analysis showed that DP remained cost-saving over AL for any DP cost below $1.23 per course of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS:
DP is superior to AL from both the clinical and economic perspectives for treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in young children. A paediatric dispersible formulation of DP is under development and should facilitate a targeted deployment of this antimalarial drug. The use of DP as first-line antimalarial drug in paediatric malaria patients in moderate to high transmission areas of Africa merits serious consideration by health policymakers.

31303294,2019,"BACKGROUND:
Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus are the most common viruses associated with acute lower respiratory infections in young children (<5 years) and older people (≥65 years). A global report of the monthly activity of these viruses is needed to inform public health strategies and programmes for their control.
METHODS:
In this systematic analysis, we compiled data from a systematic literature review of studies published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017; online datasets; and unpublished research data. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported laboratory-confirmed incidence data of human infection of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, or metapneumovirus, or a combination of these, for at least 12 consecutive months (or 52 weeks equivalent); stable testing practice throughout all years reported; virus results among residents in well-defined geographical locations; and aggregated virus results at least on a monthly basis. Data were extracted through a three-stage process, from which we calculated monthly annual average percentage (AAP) as the relative strength of virus activity. We defined duration of epidemics as the minimum number of months to account for 75% of annual positive samples, with each component month defined as an epidemic month. Furthermore, we modelled monthly AAP of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus using site-specific temperature and relative humidity for the prediction of local average epidemic months. We also predicted global epidemic months of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus on a 5° by 5° grid. The systematic review in this study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018091628.
FINDINGS:
We initally identified 37 335 eligible studies. Of 21 065 studies remaining after exclusion of duplicates, 1081 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 185 were identified as eligible. We included 246 sites for influenza virus, 183 sites for respiratory syncytial virus, 83 sites for parainfluenza virus, and 65 sites for metapneumovirus. Influenza virus had clear seasonal epidemics in winter months in most temperate sites but timing of epidemics was more variable and less seasonal with decreasing distance from the equator. Unlike influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus had clear seasonal epidemics in both temperate and tropical regions, starting in late summer months in the tropics of each hemisphere, reaching most temperate sites in winter months. In most temperate sites, influenza virus epidemics occurred later than respiratory syncytial virus (by 0·3 months [95% CI -0·3 to 0·9]) while no clear temporal order was observed in the tropics. Parainfluenza virus epidemics were found mostly in spring and early summer months in each hemisphere. Metapneumovirus epidemics occurred in late winter and spring in most temperate sites but the timing of epidemics was more diverse in the tropics. Influenza virus epidemics had shorter duration (3·8 months [3·6 to 4·0]) in temperate sites and longer duration (5·2 months [4·9 to 5·5]) in the tropics. Duration of epidemics was similar across all sites for respiratory syncytial virus (4·6 months [4·3 to 4·8]), as it was for metapneumovirus (4·8 months [4·4 to 5·1]). By comparison, parainfluenza virus had longer duration of epidemics (6·3 months [6·0 to 6·7]). Our model had good predictability in the average epidemic months of influenza virus in temperate regions and respiratory syncytial virus in both temperate and tropical regions. Through leave-one-out cross validation, the overall prediction error in the onset of epidemics was within 1 month (influenza virus -0·2 months [-0·6 to 0·1]; respiratory syncytial virus 0·1 months [-0·2 to 0·4]).
INTERPRETATION:
This study is the first to provide global representations of month-by-month activity of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus. Our model is helpful in predicting the local onset month of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics. The seasonality information has important implications for health services planning, the timing of respiratory syncytial virus passive prophylaxis, and the strategy of influenza virus and future respiratory syncytial virus vaccination.

To examine how gut microbiomes differ among human populations, here we characterize bacterial species in fecal samples from 531 individuals, plus the gene content of 110 of them. The cohort encompassed healthy children and adults from the Amazonas of Venezuela, rural Malawi and US metropolitan areas and included mono- and dizygotic twins. Shared features of the functional maturation of the gut microbiome were identified during the first three years of life in all three populations, including age-associated changes in the genes involved in vitamin biosynthesis and metabolism. Pronounced differences in bacterial assemblages and functional gene repertoires were noted between US residents and those in the other two countries. These distinctive features are evident in early infancy as well as adulthood. Our findings underscore the need to consider the microbiome when evaluating human development, nutritional needs, physiological variations and the impact of westernization.",1,1,5,0,3
22202706,2012,"OBJECTIVE:
High-quality care for intensive care unit patients and families includes palliative care. To promote performance improvement, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's National Quality Measures Clearinghouse identified nine evidence-based processes of intensive care unit palliative care (Care and Communication Bundle) that are measured through review of medical record documentation. We conducted this study to examine how frequently the Care and Communication Bundle processes were performed in diverse intensive care units and to understand patient factors that are associated with such performance.
METHODS:
Prospective, multisite, observational study of performance of key intensive care unit palliative care processes.
METHODS:
A surgical intensive care unit and a medical intensive care unit in two different large academic health centers and a medical-surgical intensive care unit in a medium-sized community hospital.
METHODS:
Consecutive adult patients with length of intensive care unit stay ≥5 days.
METHODS:
None.
RESULTS:
Between November 2007 and December 2009, we measured performance by specified day after intensive care unit admission on nine care process measures: Identify medical decision-maker, advance directive and resuscitation preference, distribute family information leaflet, assess and manage pain, offer social work and spiritual support, and conduct interdisciplinary family meeting. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine predictors of performance of five care processes. We enrolled 518 (94.9%) patients and 336 (83.6%) family members. Performances on pain assessment and management measures were high. In contrast, interdisciplinary family meetings were documented for <20% of patients by intensive care unit day 5. Performance on other measures ranged from 8% to 43%, with substantial variation across and within sites. Chronic comorbidity burden and site were the most consistent predictors of care process performance.
CONCLUSIONS:
Across three intensive care units in this study, performance of key palliative care processes (other than pain assessment and management) was inconsistent and infrequent. Available resources and strategies should be utilized for performance improvement in this area of high importance to patients, families, and providers.

Comparisons of methylation profiles among species reveal evolutionary conservation of gene body methylation patterns, pointing to the fundamental role of epigenomes in gene regulation. At the human population level, epigenomic changes provide footprints of the effects of genomic variants within the vast nonprotein-coding fraction of the genome, and comparisons of the epigenomes of parents and their offspring point to quantitative epigenomic parent-of-origin effects confounding classical Mendelian genetics. At the organismal level, comparisons of epigenomes from diverse cell types provide insights into cellular differentiation. Finally, comparisons of epigenomes from monozygotic twins help dissect genetic and environmental influences on human phenotypes and longitudinal comparisons reveal aging-associated epigenomic drift.

21344380,2011,"Exposure of live cells to shear flow induces major changes in cell shape, adhesion to the extracellular matrix, and migration. In the present study, we show that exposure of cultured multiple myeloma (MM) cells to shear flow of 4-36 dynes/cm(2) triggers the extension of long tubular protrusions (denoted flow-induced protrusions, or FLIPs) in the direction of the flow. These FLIPs were found to be rich in actin, contain few or no microtubules and, apart from endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like membranal structures, are devoid of organelles. Studying the dynamics of this process revealed that FLIPs elongate at their tips in a shear force-dependent manner, and retract at their bases. Examination of this force dependence revealed considerable heterogeneity in the mechanosensitivity of individual cells, most likely reflecting the diversity of the malignant B cell population. The mechanisms underlying FLIP formation following mechanical perturbation, and their relevance to the cellular trafficking of MM cells, are discussed.",1,0,1,0,0
25061857,2014,"Human stem cell factor initiates a diverse array of cellular responses, including hematopoiesis, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. To explore the relationship between its structure and function, we produced recombinant soluble human stem cell factor1-165 (wild type) and human stem cell factor1-141 (C-terminal truncated) in a yeast expression system and compared their biological activities and thermal stabilities. The biological activity of the two proteins was measured as a function of TF-1 cell viability and effects on downstream signaling targets after incubation. We found that these proteins enhanced cell viability and downstream signaling to a similar extent, in a dose-dependent manner. The biological activity of recombinant human stem cell factor1-165 was significantly greater than that of recombinant human stem cell factor1-141 after heating the proteins (100 ng/mL) at 25-110°C for 10 minutes (P<0.05 for all temperatures). In addition, circular dichroism spectral analysis indicated that β-sheet structures were altered in recombinant human stem cell factor1-141 but not recombinant human stem cell factor1-165 after heating at 90°C for 15 or 30 min. Molecular modeling and limited proteolytic digestion were also used to compare the thermo stability between human stem cell factor1-165 and human stem cell factor1-141.

22351883,2012,"OBJECTIVE:
In this trial, we compared Child Protective Services (CPS) recidivism outcomes between the home-based SafeCare (SC) model for child neglect and comparable home-based services, but without SC modules, for parents in the CPS system across 2 quality control strategies: coached (C) and uncoached implementation. SC is a home-based behavioral skills training model designed for neglecting or maltreating parents. The study was conducted in a scaled-up, statewide implementation setting.
METHODS:
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five maltreating parents, treated by 219 home visitors, were enrolled and treated in a 2 × 2 (SC versus services as usual × C versus uncoached implementation strategy) randomized cluster experiment. Cases were followed for an average of 6 years for CPS recidivism events. Subpopulation analyses were conducted for parents meeting customary SC inclusion criteria.
RESULTS:
Consistently significant main effects in favor of SC were found across simple and more complex modeling approaches (hazard ratios = 0.74-0.83). Larger effects were found among the subpopulation meeting customary SC inclusion criteria. C implementation yielded smaller and occasionally significant effects in analyses that included more diverse cases falling outside customary SC inclusion criteria.
CONCLUSIONS:
Findings support the adoption and use of SC within CPS home-based services systems. C implementation may be especially valuable for cases where the client-model fit is less strong.

Although environmental factors and crop management practices exert a considerable influence on wheat quality traits, a significant proportion of the variance is attributed to the genetic factors. To identify the underlying genetic factors of wheat quality parameters viz., grain protein content (GPC), grain starch content (GSC), and grain hardness (GH), we evaluated 372 diverse European wheat varieties in replicated field trials in up to eight environments. We observed that all of the investigated traits hold a wide and significant genetic variation, and a significant negative correlation exists between GPC and GSC plus grain yield. Our association analyses based on 26,694 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphic markers revealed a strong quantitative genetic nature of GPC and GSC with associations on groups 2, 3, and 6 chromosomes.

19383155,2009,"BACKGROUND:
Shotgun sequences of DNA extracts from whole organisms allow a comprehensive assessment of possible symbionts. The current project makes use of four shotgun datasets from three species of the planktonic freshwater crustaceans Daphnia: one dataset from clones of D. pulex and D. pulicaria and two datasets from one clone of D. magna. We analyzed these datasets with three aims: First, we search for bacterial symbionts, which are present in all three species. Second, we search for evidence for Cyanobacteria and plastids, which had been suggested to occur as symbionts in a related Daphnia species. Third, we compare the metacommunities revealed by two different 454 pyrosequencing methods (GS 20 and GS FLX).
RESULTS:
In all datasets we found evidence for a large number of bacteria belonging to diverse taxa. The vast majority of these were Proteobacteria. Of those, most sequences were assigned to different genera of the Betaproteobacteria family Comamonadaceae. Other taxa represented in all datasets included the genera Flavobacterium, Rhodobacter, Chromobacterium, Methylibium, Bordetella, Burkholderia and Cupriavidus. A few taxa matched sequences only from the D. pulex and the D. pulicaria datasets: Aeromonas, Pseudomonas and Delftia. Taxa with many hits specific to a single dataset were rare. For most of the identified taxa earlier studies reported the finding of related taxa in aquatic environmental samples. We found no clear evidence for the presence of symbiotic Cyanobacteria or plastids. The apparent similarity of the symbiont communities of the three Daphnia species breaks down on a species and strain level. Communities have a similar composition at a higher taxonomic level, but the actual sequences found are divergent. The two Daphnia magna datasets obtained from two different pyrosequencing platforms revealed rather similar results.
CONCLUSIONS:
Three clones from three species of the genus Daphnia were found to harbor a rich community of symbionts. These communities are similar at the genus and higher taxonomic level, but are composed of different species. The similarity of these three symbiont communities hints that some of these associations may be stable in the long-term.

However, although India comprises more than one sixth of the world's human population, it has largely been omitted from genomic surveys that provide the backdrop for association studies of genetic disease. Here, by genotyping India-born individuals sampled in the United States, we carry out an extensive study of Indian genetic variation. We analyze 1,200 genome-wide polymorphisms in 432 individuals from 15 Indian populations.

However, only a relatively small amount of genetic differentiation exists among the Indian populations. Although caution is warranted due to the fact that United States-sampled Indian populations do not represent a random sample from India, these results suggest that the frequencies of many genetic variants are distinctive in India compared to other parts of the world and that the effects of population heterogeneity on the production of false positives in association studies may be smaller in Indians (and particularly in Indian-Americans) than might be expected for such a geographically and linguistically diverse subset of the human population.",1,0,1,0,16

28683834,2017,"BACKGROUND:
The prevalence of acute malnutrition is often high in emergency-affected populations and is associated with elevated mortality risk and long-term health consequences. Increasingly, cash transfer programmes (CTP) are used instead of direct food aid as a nutritional intervention, but there is sparse evidence on their nutritional impact. We aim to understand whether CTP reduces acute malnutrition and its known risk factors.
METHODS/DESIGN:
A non-randomised, cluster-controlled trial will assess the impact of an unconditional cash transfer of US$84 per month for 5 months, a single non-food items kit, and free piped water on the risk of acute malnutrition in children, aged 6-59 months. The study will take place in camps for internally displaced persons (IDP) in peri-urban Mogadishu, Somalia. A cluster will consist of one IDP camp and 10 camps will be allocated to receive the intervention based on vulnerability targeting criteria. The control camps will then be selected from the same geographical area. Needs assessment data indicates small differences in vulnerability between camps. In each trial arm, 120 households will be randomly sampled and two detailed household surveys will be implemented at baseline and 3 months after the initiation of the cash transfer. The survey questionnaire will cover risk factors for malnutrition including household expenditure, assets, food security, diet diversity, coping strategies, morbidity, WASH, and access to health care. A community surveillance system will collect monthly mid-upper arm circumference measurements from all children aged 6-59 months in the study clusters to assess the incidence of acute malnutrition over the duration of the intervention. Process evaluation data will be compiled from routine quantitative programme data and primary qualitative data collected using key informant interviews and focus group discussions. The UK Department for International Development will provide funding for this study. The European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations will fund the intervention. Concern Worldwide will implement the intervention as part of their humanitarian programming.
DISCUSSION:
This non-randomised cluster controlled trial will provide needed evidence on the role of unconditional CTP in reducing the risk of acute malnutrition among IDP in this context.

19535379,2009,"Connexin40 (Cx40) is a major gap-junction protein in the atrial myocardium. In the heart, gap junctions are responsible for cell-to-cell conduction of the action potential. In several cardiac diseases, the expression of connexins is changed and is associated with increased propensity for arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in man with a diverse clinical presentation, different underlying mechanisms, and difficult treatment. The vulnerability to arrhythmias of the heart is determined by the combined presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate and initiating triggers. The arrhythmogenic substrate is formed by reduced effective refractory period, enhanced spatial dispersion of refractoriness, or abnormal atrial impulse conduction. Initiating triggers of AF most frequently originate from firing foci in the pulmonary veins and/or superior caval vein. Prolonged episodes of AF result in electrical and structural remodelling that favours the reoccurrence or perpetuation of AF. This electrical remodelling embodies changes in Cx40 expression and distribution, both in the atrial myocardium itself and in the thoracic veins. In addition, Cx40 gene mutations or polymorphisms give an inherited predisposition to AF. This review focuses on the role of Cx40 in AF, showing that abnormal Cx40 expression is correlated with both trigger formation from the thoracic veins as well as enhanced vulnerability of the atrial myocardium to AF.",1,1,2,0,0

The mitogenomes of 15 earthworm species were sequenced and compared with other 9 available earthworm mitogenomes, with the main aim to explore their phylogenetic relationships and test different analytical approaches on phylogeny reconstruction. The general earthworm mitogenomic features revealed to be conservative: all genes encoded on the same strand, all the protein coding loci shared the same initiation codon (ATG), and tRNA genes showed conserved structures. The Drawida japonica mitogenome displayed the highest A + T content, reversed AT/GC-skews and the highest genetic diversity. Genetic distances among protein coding genes displayed their maximum and minimum interspecific values in the ATP8 and CO1 genes, respectively.

10319256,1999,"The mammalian major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has taught both immunologists and evolutionary biologists a great deal about the patterns and processes that have led to immune defenses. Driven principally by human and mouse studies, comparative MHC projects among other mammalian species offer certain advantages in connecting MHC genome characters to natural situations. We have studied the MHC in the domestic cat and in several wild species of Felidae. Our observations affirm class I and class II homology with other mammalian orders, derivative gene duplications during the Felidae radiation, abundant persistent trans-species allele polymorphism, recombination-derived amino acid motifs, and inverted ratios of non-synonymous to silent substitutions in the MHC peptide-binding regions, consistent with overdominant selection in class I and II genes. MHC diversity as quantified in population studies is a powerful barometer of historic demographic reduction for several endangered species including cheetahs, Asiatic lions, Florida panthers and tigers. In two cases (Florida panther and cheetah), reduced MHC variation may be contributing to uniform population sensitivity to emerging infectious pathogens. The Felidae species, nearly all endangered and monitored for conservation concerns, have allowed a glimpse of species adaptation, mediated by MHC divergence, using comparative inferences drawn from human and mouse models.",1,0,1,0,2
19846850,2009,"BACKGROUND:
Recent studies indicate an increased frequency of mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a deficiency of which causes Gaucher's disease, among patients with Parkinson's disease. We aimed to ascertain the frequency of GBA mutations in an ethnically diverse group of patients with Parkinson's disease.
METHODS:
Sixteen centers participated in our international, collaborative study: five from the Americas, six from Europe, two from Israel, and three from Asia. Each center genotyped a standard DNA panel to permit comparison of the genotyping results across centers. Genotypes and phenotypic data from a total of 5691 patients with Parkinson's disease (780 Ashkenazi Jews) and 4898 controls (387 Ashkenazi Jews) were analyzed, with multivariate logistic-regression models and the Mantel-Haenszel procedure used to estimate odds ratios across centers.
RESULTS:
All 16 centers could detect two GBA mutations, L444P and N370S. Among Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, either mutation was found in 15% of patients and 3% of controls, and among non-Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, either mutation was found in 3% of patients and less than 1% of controls. GBA was fully sequenced for 1883 non-Ashkenazi Jewish patients, and mutations were identified in 7%, showing that limited mutation screening can miss half the mutant alleles. The odds ratio for any GBA mutation in patients versus controls was 5.43 across centers. As compared with patients who did not carry a GBA mutation, those with a GBA mutation presented earlier with the disease, were more likely to have affected relatives, and were more likely to have atypical clinical manifestations.
CONCLUSIONS:
Data collected from 16 centers demonstrate that there is a strong association between GBA mutations and Parkinson's disease.

However, several major areas of continued unmet need in the care of patients with PsD have been identified. One of these areas is the prediction of poor outcome, notably radiographic outcome in patients with psoriatic arthritis, so that stratified medicine approaches can be taken; another is predicting response to the numerous current and emerging therapies for PsD, so that precision medicine can be applied to rapidly improve clinical outcome and reduce the risk of toxicity. In order to address these needs, novel approaches, including imaging, tissue analysis and the application of proteogenomic technologies, are proposed as methodological solutions that will assist the dissection of the critical immune-metabolic pathways in this complex disease.

16446060,2006,"Bid, BH3-interacting domain death agonist, was initially cloned based in its ability to interact with both Bcl-2 and Bax. Bid contains only the BH3 domain, which is required for its interaction with the Bcl-2 family proteins and for its pro-death activity. Bid is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by caspases, calpains, Granzyme B and cathepsins. Bid is important to cell death mediated by these proteases and thus is the sentinel to protease-mediated death signals. Protease-cleaved Bid is able to induce multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions, including the release of the inter-membrane space proteins, cristae reorganization, depolarization, permeability transition and generation of reactive oxygen species. Thus Bid is the molecular linker bridging various peripheral death pathways to the central mitochondria pathway. Recent studies further indicate that Bid may be more than just a killer molecule. Deletion of Bid inhibits carcinogenesis in the liver, although this genetic alteration promotes tumorigenesis in the myeloid cells. This is likely related to the function of Bid to promote cell cycle progression into S phase. Bid could be also involved in the maintenance of genomic stability by engaging at mitosis checkpoint. These novel findings indicate that this BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein has a diverse array of functions that are important to both the life and death of the cell.",1,0,1,0,0

In ovarian amplification-stage follicle cell nuclei, the largest subunit, Mip130, is a negative regulator of replication, whereas another subunit, Myb, is a positive regulator. Here, we identified a mutation in mip40 and generated a mutation in mip120, two additional MMB subunits. Both mutants were viable, but mip120 mutants had many complex phenotypes including shortened longevity and severe eye defects. mip40 mutant females had severely reduced fertility, whereas mip120 mutant females were sterile, substantiating ovarian regulatory role(s) for MMB. Myb accumulation and binding to polytene chromosomes was dependent on the core factors of the MMB complex. In contrast to the documented mip130 mutant phenotypes, both mip40 and mip120 mutant males were sterile. We purified Mip40-containing complexes from testis nuclear extracts and identified tMAC, a new testis-specific meiotic arrest complex that contained Mip40, Caf1/p55, the Mip130 family member, Always early (Aly), and a Mip120 family member, Tombola (Tomb).

26676576,2015,"To dissect the kinetics of structural transitions underlying the stepping cycle of kinesin-1 at physiological ATP, we used interferometric scattering microscopy to track the position of gold nanoparticles attached to individual motor domains in processively stepping dimers. Labeled heads resided stably at positions 16.4 nm apart, corresponding to a microtubule-bound state, and at a previously unseen intermediate position, corresponding to a tethered state. The chemical transitions underlying these structural transitions were identified by varying nucleotide conditions and carrying out parallel stopped-flow kinetics assays. At saturating ATP, kinesin-1 spends half of each stepping cycle with one head bound, specifying a structural state for each of two rate-limiting transitions. Analysis of stepping kinetics in varying nucleotides shows that ATP binding is required to properly enter the one-head-bound state, and hydrolysis is necessary to exit it at a physiological rate. These transitions differ from the standard model in which ATP binding drives full docking of the flexible neck linker domain of the motor. Thus, this work defines a consensus sequence of mechanochemical transitions that can be used to understand functional diversity across the kinesin superfamily. ",1,0,1,0,0

28636674,2017,"OBJECTIVE:
To examine the impact on infant and young child nutrition knowledge and practice of mothers who were neighbors of mothers participating in a nutrition Behavior Change Communication (BCC) intervention in rural Bangladesh.
METHODS:
We analyzed data from 300 mothers whose neighbor participated in a nutrition BCC intervention and 600 mothers whose neighbor participated in an intervention that did not include BCC. We constructed measures capturing mothers' knowledge of infant and young child nutrition (IYCN) and measures of food consumption by children 6-24m. The effect on these outcomes of exposure to a neighbor receiving a nutrition BCC intervention was estimated using ordinary least squares and probit regressions. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Study ID: NCT02237144).
RESULTS:
Having a neighboring mother participate in a nutrition BCC intervention increased non-participant mothers' IYCN knowledge by 0.17 SD (translating to 0.3 more correct answers). They were 14.1 percentage points more likely to feed their 6-24m children legumes and nuts; 11.6 percentage points more likely to feed these children vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables; and 10.0 percentage points more likely to feed these children eggs. Children of non-participant mothers who had a neighboring mother participate in a nutrition BCC intervention were 13.8 percentage points more likely to meet World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for minimum diet diversity, 11.9 percentage points more likely to meet WHO guidelines for minimum acceptable diet, and 10.3 percentage points more likely to meet WHO guidelines for minimum meal frequency for children who continue to be breastfed after age 6m. Children aged 0-6m of non-participant mothers who are neighbors of mothers receiving BCC were 7.1 percentage points less likely to have ever consumed water-based liquids.
CONCLUSIONS:
Studies of nutrition BCC that do not account for information spillovers to non-participants may underestimate its benefits in terms of IYCN knowledge and practice.

25830554,2015,"Dendritic epidermal T cells, which express an invariant Vγ5Vδ1 T-cell receptor and account for 95% of all resident T cells in the mouse epidermis, play a critical role in skin immune surveillance. These γδ T cells are generated by positive selection in the fetal thymus, after which they migrate to the skin. The development of dendritic epidermal T cells is critically dependent on the Skint1 gene expressed specifically in keratinocytes and thymic epithelial cells, suggesting an indispensable role for Skint1 in the selection machinery for specific intraepithelial lymphocytes. Phylogenetically, rodents have functional SKINT1 molecules, but humans and chimpanzees have a SKINT1-like (SKINT1L) gene with multiple inactivating mutations. In the present study, we analyzed SKINT1L sequences in representative primate species and found that all hominoid species have a common inactivating mutation, but that Old World monkeys such as olive baboons, green monkeys, cynomolgus macaques and rhesus macaques have apparently functional SKINT1L sequences, indicating that SKINT1L was inactivated in a common ancestor of hominoids. Interestingly, the epidermis of cynomolgus macaques contained a population of dendritic-shaped γδ T cells expressing a semi-invariant Vγ10/Vδ1 T-cell receptor. However, this population of macaque T cells differed from rodent dendritic epidermal T cells in that their Vγ10/Vδ1 T-cell receptors displayed junctional diversity and expression of Vγ10 was not epidermis-specific. Therefore, macaques do not appear to have rodent-type dendritic epidermal T cells despite having apparently functional SKINT1L. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis indicates that SKINT1L emerged in an ancestor of placental mammals but was inactivated or lost multiple times in mammalian evolution and that Skint1 arose by gene duplication in a rodent lineage, suggesting that authentic dendritic epidermal T cells are presumably unique to rodents.

In this study, we show that murine memory CD8(+) T cells can divide asymmetrically in response to secondary encounter with pathogen. Critical regulators of signaling and transcription are partitioned to one side of the mitotic spindle in rechallenged memory T cells, and two phenotypically distinct populations of daughter cells are evident from the earliest divisions.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) as well as CpG methylation (CpG) assays, followed by massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq and CpG-seq) identified unique hyperacetylation and CpG methylation signatures with proximal and distal patterns of regionalization associative with gene expression.

17015498,2006,"OBJECTIVE:
Among premature infants, formula feeding increases the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis, delayed brainstem maturation, decreased scoring on cognitive and developmental tests, and delayed visual development. With this in mind, many interventions are designed to increase breast milk consumption in preterm infants. Breastfeeding initiation rates among US premature infants are not collected nationally, however, and published data on breastfeeding rates in this population are limited. In addition, national surveys calculate breastfeeding rates among term infants according to maternal race/ethnicity, but maternal birthplace is not recorded. This is likely to be important, because breastfeeding is the cultural norm in the countries of origin for many non-US-born US residents. Massachusetts has a diverse racial/ethnic population, including many non-US-born women. The goals of this study were to compare breastfeeding initiation rates among preterm and term infants in Massachusetts in 2002 and to determine the effect of maternal race/ethnicity and birthplace on breastfeeding initiation rates among term and preterm infants.
METHODS:
Massachusetts Community Health Information Profile, an online public health database that was created by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, includes breastfeeding initiation data that are obtained from the electronic birth certificate, which we used to compare breastfeeding rates among preterm and term infants. Birth-linked demographics and data that also were accessed were maternal age, race/ethnicity, birthplace, and health insurance (public or private) as an indicator of socioeconomic status and infant's gestational age. We assessed the association between breastfeeding initiation and maternal birthplace, as well as race/ethnicity and the other potential confounders, using logistic regression.
RESULTS:
There were 80,624 births in Massachusetts in 2002, and 8.2% (6611) of newborns had a gestational age <37 weeks. The state's overall breastfeeding initiation rate was 74.6%. We excluded records of mothers who were younger than 15 years and older than 39 years, nonsingleton births, infants with a gestational age <24 weeks and >42 weeks, and records with missing data. Of the total births in Massachusetts, 67,884 (84%) met inclusion criteria for this study. Breastfeeding initiation rates were lowest among preterm infants of the youngest gestational ages. Breastfeeding initiation was 76.8% among term infants born at 37 to 42 weeks, 70.1% among infants born at 32 to 36 weeks, and 62.9% among infants born at 24 to 31 weeks. In univariate analysis, among preterm infants, a lower proportion of US-born black, Asian, and Hispanic mothers initiated breastfeeding than US-born white mothers; non-US-born black and non-US-born Hispanic mothers had the highest breastfeeding initiation rates. Among term infants, US-born black mothers had the lowest initiation rates, and non-US-born black and non-US-born Hispanic mothers had the highest. In multivariate logistic regression, however, after controlling for mother's age, race, birthplace, and insurance, US-born white mothers were least likely to breastfeed either term or preterm infants when compared with any other racial/ethnic group, including US-born black mothers. The likelihood that non-US-born Hispanic mothers would breastfeed was almost 8 times greater than that for US-born white mothers for a preterm infant and almost 10 times greater for a term infant. In multivariate logistic regression analysis stratified by gestational age for both preterm and term infants, older mothers and mothers with private health insurance were most likely to breastfeed.
CONCLUSIONS:
In Massachusetts, preterm infants were less likely to receive breast milk than term infants, and the likelihood of receiving breast milk was lowest among the youngest preterm infants. In multivariate logistic regression, mothers who were born outside the United States were more likely than US-born mothers to breastfeed either term or preterm infants in all racial and ethnic groups. In an unexpected finding, US-born white mothers were less likely to breastfeed term or preterm infants than US-born black mothers or mothers of any other racial or ethnic group.

Seven accessions showed a higher level of tolerance than Col-0. The young seedlings of the tolerant accessions demonstrated a higher K(+) content and a lower Na(+)/K(+) ratio when exposed to salinity stress, but its Na(+) content was the same as that of Col-0. The K(+) transporter genes AtHAK5, AtCHX17 and AtKUP1 were up-regulated significantly in almost all the tolerant accessions, even in the absence of salinity stress. There was little genetic variation or positive transcriptional variation between the selections and Col-0 with respect to Na+-related transporter genes, as AtSOS genes, AtNHX1 and AtHKT1;1. In addition, under salinity stress, these selections accumulated higher compatible solutes and lower reactive oxygen species than did Col-0.

16630341,2006,"BACKGROUND:
While many common chemotherapeutic drugs and other inducers of DNA-damage result in both NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and DNA-binding, we have previously observed that, depending on the precise stimulus, there is great diversity of the function of NF-kappaB. In particular, we found that treatment of U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells with the anthracycine daunorubicin or with ultraviolet (UV-C) light resulted in a form of NF-kappaB that repressed rather than induced NF-kappaB reporter plasmids and the expression of specific anti-apoptotic genes. Anthracyclines such as daunorubicin can induce DNA-damage though inhibiting topoisomerase II, intercalating with DNA and undergoing redox cycling to produce oxygen free radicals. In this study we have investigated other anthracyclines, doxorubicin and aclarubicin, as well as the anthracenedione mitoxantrone together with the topoisomerase II inhibitor ICRF-193, which all possess differing characteristics, to determine which of these features is specifically required to induce both NF-kappaB DNA-binding and transcriptional repression in U-2 OS cells.
RESULTS:
The use of mitoxantrone, which does not undergo redox cycling, and the reducing agent epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) demonstrated that oxygen free radical production is not required for induction of NF-kappaB DNA-binding and transcriptional repression by these agents and UV-C. In addition, the use of aclarubicin, which does not directly inhibit topoisomerase II and ICRF-193, which inhibits topoisomerase II but does not intercalate into DNA, demonstrated that topoisomerase II inhibition is not sufficient to induce the repressor form of NF-kappaB.
CONCLUSIONS:
Induction of NF-kappaB DNA-binding and transcriptional repression by topoisomerase II inhibitors was found to correlate with an ability to intercalate into DNA. Although data from our and other laboratories indicates that topoisomerase II inhibition and oxygen free radicals do regulate NF-kappaB, they are not required for the particular ability of NF-kappaB to repress rather than activate transcription. Together with our previous data, these results demonstrate that the nature of the NF-kappaB response is context dependent. In a clinical setting such effects could profoundly influence the response to chemotherapy and suggest that new methods of analyzing NF-kappaB function could have both diagnostic and prognostic value.

14668360,2003,"The yeast pheromone/filamentous growth MAPK pathway mediates both mating and invasive-growth responses. The interface between this MAPK module and the transcriptional machinery consists of a network of two MAPKs, Fus3 and Kss1; two regulators, Rst1 and Rst2 (a.k.a. Dig1 and Dig2); and two transcription factors, Ste12 and Tec1. Of 16 possible combinations of gene deletions in FUS3, KSS1, RST1, and RST2 in the sigma1278 background, 10 display constitutive invasive growth. Rst1 was the primary negative regulator of invasive growth, while other components either attenuated or enhanced invasive growth, depending on the genetic context. Despite activation of the invasive response by lesions at the same level in the MAPK pathway, transcriptional profiles of different invasive mutant combinations did not exhibit a unified program of gene expression. The distal MAPK regulatory network is thus capable of generating phenotypically similar invasive-growth states (an attractor) from different molecular architectures (trajectories) that can functionally compensate for one another.

However, little is known about socioeconomic disparities and mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. This study systematically reviews publications on the relationships between various commonly used indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) and mental health outcomes for children and adolescents aged four to 18 years. Studies published in English or German between 1990 and 2011 were included if they reported at least one marker of socioeconomic status (an index or indicators, e.g., household income, poverty, parental education, parental occupation status, or family affluence) and identified mental health problems using validated instruments. In total, 55 published studies met the inclusion criteria, and 52 studies indicated an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and mental health problems in children and adolescents. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children and adolescents were two to three times more likely to develop mental health problems. Low socioeconomic status that persisted over time was strongly related to higher rates of mental health problems. A decrease in socioeconomic status was associated with increasing mental health problems. The strength of the correlation varied with age and with different indicators of socioeconomic status, whereas heterogeneous findings were reported for gender and types of mental health problems. The included studies indicated that the theoretical approaches of social causation and classical selection are not mutually exclusive across generations and specific mental health problems; these processes create a cycle of deprivation and mental health problems. The review draws attention to the diversity of measures used to evaluate socioeconomic status, which might have influenced the comparability of international epidemiological studies.

28068418,2017,"Studying the mating system of obligate aquatic organisms that inhabit river ecosystems is important for understanding its evolution as well as the role of biological and environmental factors in modulating population dynamics and species distributional patterns. Here, we studied the reproductive strategy of the Chilean endemic freshwater snail, Chilina dombeiana, in the Biobío River, one of the largest rivers in Chile. This species has a low potential for dispersal given the absence of a free-swimming larval stage (benthic larval development) and given that adults have a low capacity for mobility. We hypothesized that: 1. Females would mate with different males (polyandry) resulting in intrabrood multiple paternity, 2. Individuals from closer sites would be more related than individuals from distant sites, and 3. Male parental contributions would be unevenly distributed within broods. Individuals from three different sites were sampled along the river: upper, mid, and river mouth. In the laboratory, hatching juveniles from a total of 15 broods were collected for paternity analyses. We used microsatellite markers and the programs GERUD and COLONY to determine whether multiple paternity exists and to estimate the contribution of different males to the brood. We found that multiple paternity was very common at all of the sites analyzed with as many as 8 males fertilizing a single female and a mean of 4.2 fathers per brood estimated by COLONY. Sire contribution was skewed to particular males in several broods. In addition, overall relatedness among broods for the three sites ranged from 0.17 to 0.45 with evidence of many half-siblings. Relatedness differed among the three sites. Particularly in upstream sites or in anthropogenically disturbed populations, the high levels of multiple paternity observed in C. dombeiana may be an efficient strategy to avoid inbreeding and prevent the loss of genetic diversity within populations.",1,1,8,0,2

29534035,2018,"Ever since Bitner defined the term ""servicescape"" as the physical environment in which the service is assembled, several scholars have attempted to better understand the impact of the built environment in the context of different service settings. While servicescape is a topic of increasing academic interest among scholars and practitioners, most studies in the area are dedicated to understanding the built environment of hedonic service. More studies are needed to examine utilitarian servicescape and in this paper, we have focused on the healthcare environment. This study aims to identify the gap in servicescape and healthscape studies by providing a theoretical structure of the current servicescape literature and comprehend the academic differences between hedonic servicescape and utilitarian healthscape studies. After reviewing 44 selected papers based on rigorous criteria, we: (1) framed the servicescape factors; (2) analyzed the servicescape literature from the perspectives of terminologies, research fields, methodologies, and frameworks; and (3) identified the current paths of healthscape research. Through this work, we highlight the significance of adopting different dimensions and factors to evaluate the distinguished service environment by the servicescape type and propose several research agendas for future studies on healthscapes. The research findings can contribute to a deep understanding of healthscapes and can introduce a new viewpoint for interpreting the servicescape in diversified service settings.",1,0,1,0,0
26119686,2015,"Restriction of nutrients in the adult diet extends lifespan across a diverse range of species, but less is known about the long-term effects of developmental dietary restriction. In particular, it is not known whether adult lifespan is influenced by developmental caloric restriction or macronutrient balance. We used the nutritional geometry approach to independently manipulate protein and carbohydrate contents of the larval diet in the neriid fly, Telostylinus angusticollis, and measured adult lifespan. We found that adult male and female lifespan was shortest when larvae were fed a protein restricted diet. Thus, protein restriction in the larval diet has the opposite effect of protein restriction in the adult diet (which prolongs life in this species and across a wide range of taxa). Adult lifespan was unaffected by larval dietary carbohydrate. These patterns persisted after controlling for larval diet effects on adult body size. We propose that larval and adult protein sources are used for distinct metabolic tasks: during development, dietary protein is used to build a durable soma that enhances adult lifespan, although excessive protein consumption partially reverses this effect.

10091255,1999,"The Norris Farms No. 36 cemetery in central Illinois has been the subject of considerable archaeological and genetic research. Both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA have been examined in this 700-year-old population. DNA preservation at the site was good, with about 70% of the samples producing mtDNA results and approximately 15% yielding nuclear DNA data. All four of the major Amerindian mtDNA haplogroups were found, in addition to a fifth haplogroup. Sequences of the first hypervariable region of the mtDNA control region revealed a high level of diversity in the Norris Farms population and confirmed that the fifth haplogroup associates with Mongolian sequences and hence is probably authentic. Other than a possible reduction in the number of rare mtDNA lineages in many populations, it does not appear as if European contact significantly altered patterns of Amerindian mtDNA variation, despite the large decrease in population size that occurred. For nuclear DNA analysis, a novel method for DNA-based sex identification that uses nucleotide differences between the X and Y copies of the amelogenin gene was developed and applied successfully in approximately 20 individuals. Despite the well-known problems of poor DNA preservation and the ever-present possibility of contamination with modern DNA, genetic analysis of the Norris Farms No. 36 population demonstrates that ancient DNA can be a fruitful source of new insights into prehistoric populations.",1,1,3,0,3
15714176,2005,"BACKGROUND:
Immune reconstitution after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) occurs gradually. Thus, a variable period of immunodeficiency may be present, leading to immunomediated complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and opportunistic infections.
METHODS:
To better understand the kinetics of B-cell repertoire reconstitution in children, 49 pediatric patients were analyzed before and after transplantation by immunoglobulin (Ig) HCDR3 fingerprinting, which is a molecular technique that analyzes one of the hypervariable segments of the Ig heavy chain, which provides the amino acid residues that are essential to interact with antigens.
RESULTS:
In healthy donors, the CDR3 fingerprinting profile shows 16 to 20 bands, and each band corresponds to a particular length of CDR3. This situation is considered polyclonal. Patients analyzed just after transplantation show strong oligoclonality, because only a few CDR3 bands are detected within the first 3 to 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS:
The authors' data show a significant lag in diversification of the B-cell repertoire, which reaches the polyclonal situation of normal healthy donors approximately 6 months after HSCT. This period may vary depending on the type of transplant (autologous vs. allogeneic) and on the immunosuppressive therapy related to GVHD.

However, a good deal of sex differences in health issues have their origins in the genes on the sex chromosomes themselves and in X inactivation-the developmental program that equalizes their expression in males and females. Most females are mosaics, having a mixture of cells expressing either their mother's or father's X-linked genes. Often, cell mosaicism is advantageous, ameliorating the deleterious effects of X-linked mutations and contributing to physiological diversity. As a consequence, most X-linked mutations produce male-only diseases. Yet, in some cases the dynamic interactions between cells in mosaic females lead to female-specific disease manifestations.",1,1,9,0,0

A 68-year-old man suffered from multiple strokes in the left hemisphere 11 years before presentation, resulting in medically refractory right-sided hemibody CPSP. He was implanted with a directional DBS electrode in the left ventrocaudal nucleus of the thalamus. A directional single-segment contact configuration produced a better improvement throughout the contralateral body side than ring-mode and other directional configurations. Treatment led to a reduction of almost 50% in pain. This case demonstrates the value of directional DBS in the treatment of chronic pain, as steering increases selectivity and reduces side effects in a small target area surrounded by structures with high functional diversity.",1,1,3,0,0
21860295,2011,"OBJECTIVE:
To estimate the relation of smoking status and smoking intensity with bladder symptoms.
METHODS:
Questionnaires were mailed to 3,000 women (aged 18-79 years) randomly identified from the Finnish Population Register. Case definitions for stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urgency, and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) were ""often"" or ""always"" based on reported occurrence (never, rarely, often, always). Case definitions for urinary frequency were based on reporting of longest voiding interval as less than 2 hours and for nocturia reporting of at least two voids per night. Potential confounders included comorbidities, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors.
RESULTS:
Responses totaled 2,002 (67.0%). Frequency was reported by 7.1%, nocturia 12.6%, SUI 11.2%, urgency 9.7%, and UUI 3.1%. In the multivariable analyses, smoking was associated with urgency (odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-4.2 for current and OR 1.8, CI 1.2-2.9 for former compared with never smokers) and frequency (OR 3.0, CI 1.8-5.0 for current and OR 1.7, CI 1.0-3.1 for former smokers) but not with nocturia and SUI. Adjusted prevalence differences between never and current smokers were 6.0% (3.0-9.1%) for urgency and 6.0% (3.3-8.7%) for frequency. Similarly, current heavy (compared with light) smoking was associated with additional risk of urgency (OR 2.1, CI 1.1-3.9) and frequency (OR 2.2, CI 1.2-4.3).
CONCLUSIONS:
Urgency and frequency are approximately three times more common among current than never smokers. Parallel associations for urgency and frequency with smoking intensity suggest a dose-response relationship. Nocturia and SUI are not associated with smoking. These results suggest an additional rationale for smoking cessation in women seeking medical attention for bladder symptoms and highlight the diversity between such symptoms.

GAS strains belonging to M types M1 and M3 are associated with TSS. This study aims to obtain insight into the gene profiles underlying different M types and disease manifestations. Genomic differences between 76 clinically well characterized GAS strains collected in The Netherlands were examined using a mixed-genome microarray. Inter-M-type genomic differences clearly outweighed intra-M-type genome variation. Phages were major contributors to observed genome diversification. We identified four novel genes, including two genes encoding fibronectin-binding-like proteins, which are highly specific to a subset of M types and thus may contribute to M-type-associated disease manifestations. All M12 strains were characterized by the unique absence of the citrate lyase complex and reduced growth under hypoxic, nutrient-deprived conditions. Furthermore, six virulence factors, including genes encoding a complement-inhibiting protein (sic), an exotoxin (speA), iron(III) binding factor, collagen binding factor (cpa), and fibrinogen binding factor (prt2-like), were unique to M1 and/or M3 strains. These virulence factors may contribute to the potential of these strains to cause TSS. Finally, in contrast to M-type-specific virulence profiles, we did not identify a common virulence profile among strains associated with TSS irrespective of their M type.",1,0,1,0,1

Height, weight, dietary intake, physical activity record, and lifestyle and demographic characteristics were measured. There was no evidence of undernutrition because linear growth was appropriate for age, but 39.4% of children were overweight (>85th percentile NHANES II). Dietary fat intake was higher in children from single-parent families (P < 0.001) and those with mothers born in Canada. Intake of vitamins A, C, iron and folate was directly related to income sufficiency. Children who did more physical activity had significantly higher intakes of energy, calcium, iron, zinc and fiber but were not heavier. Dietary intake was systematically underreported among overweight children, i.e., their reported intakes did not meet calculated energy needs.

14592958,2003,"Previous studies dealing with the mechanisms underlying the tissue-specific and regulated expression of the GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) gene led us to define several cis-acting regulatory sequences in the rat GnRH-R gene promoter. These include functional sites for steroidogenic factor 1, activator protein 1, and motifs related to GATA and LIM homeodomain response elements as demonstrated primarily in transient transfection assays in mouse gonadotrope-derived cell lines. To understand these mechanisms in more depth, we generated transgenic mice bearing the 3.3-kb rat GnRH-R promoter linked to the human placental alkaline phosphatase reporter gene. Here we show that the rat GnRH-R promoter drives the expression of the reporter gene in pituitary cells expressing the LHbeta and/or FSHbeta subunit but not in TSHbeta- or GH-positive cells. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal pattern of the transgene expression during the development of the pituitary was compatible with that characterizing the emergence of the gonadotrope lineage. In particular, transgene expression is colocalized with the expression of the glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit at embryonic day 13.5 and with that of steroidogenic factor 1 at later stages of pituitary development. Transgene expression was also found in specific brain areas, such as the lateral septum and the hippocampus. A single promoter is thus capable of directing transcription in highly diverse tissues, raising the question of the different combinations of transcription factors that lead to such a multiple, but nevertheless cell-specific, expressions of the GnRH-R gene.",1,0,1,0,0
29408497,2018,"The spice turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) has a long history of use as an anti-inflammatory agent. The active component curcumin induces a variety of diverse biological effects and forms a series of degradation and metabolic products in vivo. Our hypothesis is that the field of toxicogenomics provides tools that can be used to characterize the mode of action and toxicity of turmeric components and to predict turmeric-drug interactions. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 4 days with turmeric root containing about 3% curcumin (comparable to what people consume in the fresh or dried root) or a fraction of turmeric enriched for curcumin (∼74%) and liver tissue collected for gene expression analysis. Two doses of each agent were added to the diet, corresponding to 540 and 2700 mg/kg body weight/day of turmeric. The transcriptomic effects of turmeric on rat liver tissue were examined using 3 programs, ToxFx Analysis Suite, in the context of a large drug database, Ingenuity Pathway and NextBio analyses. ToxFx analysis indicates that turmeric containing about 3% or 74% curcumin represses the expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes. The dose of 400 mg/kg b.w./day curcumin induced the Drug Signature associated with hepatic inflammatory infiltrate. Ingenuity analysis confirmed that all 4 turmeric treatments had a significant effect on cholesterol biosynthesis, specifically the Cholesterol biosynthesis superpathway and Cholesterol biosynthesis 1 and 2. Among the top 10 up or downregulated genes, all 4 treatments downregulated PDK4; while 3 treatments downregulated ANGPTL4 or FASN. These findings suggest curcumin may enhance the anticancer effects of certain classes of statins, which we confirmed with biological assays. Given this enhancement, lower levels of statins may be required, and even be desirable. Our findings also warn of possible safety issues, such as potential inflammatory liver effects, for patients who ingest a combination of certain classes of statins and curcumin. Transcriptomic analysis suggests that turmeric is worthwhile to study to prevent and treat cancer and lipid disorders. Our approach lays new groundwork for studies of the mode of action and safety of herbal medicines and can also be used to develop a methodology to standardize herbal medicines.",1,1,2,0,0
15596722,2004,"We report the complete genome sequence of the deep-sea gamma-proteobacterium, Idiomarina loihiensis, isolated recently from a hydrothermal vent at 1,300-m depth on the Loihi submarine volcano, Hawaii. The I. loihiensis genome comprises a single chromosome of 2,839,318 base pairs, encoding 2,640 proteins, four rRNA operons, and 56 tRNA genes. A comparison of I. loihiensis to the genomes of other gamma-proteobacteria reveals abundance of amino acid transport and degradation enzymes, but a loss of sugar transport systems and certain enzymes of sugar metabolism. This finding suggests that I. loihiensis relies primarily on amino acid catabolism, rather than on sugar fermentation, for carbon and energy. Enzymes for biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, the majority of amino acids, and coenzymes are encoded in the genome, but biosynthetic pathways for Leu, Ile, Val, Thr, and Met are incomplete. Auxotrophy for Val and Thr was confirmed by in vivo experiments. The I. loihiensis genome contains a cluster of 32 genes encoding enzymes for exopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide synthesis. It also encodes diverse peptidases, a variety of peptide and amino acid uptake systems, and versatile signal transduction machinery. We propose that the source of amino acids for I. loihiensis growth are the proteinaceous particles present in the deep sea hydrothermal vent waters. I. loihiensis would colonize these particles by using the secreted exopolysaccharide, digest these proteins, and metabolize the resulting peptides and amino acids. In summary, the I. loihiensis genome reveals an integrated mechanism of metabolic adaptation to the constantly changing deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystem.",1,0,1,0,1

Whole-genome sequencing of MRSA has been used to define phylogeny and transmission in well-resourced healthcare settings, yet the greatest burden of nosocomial infection occurs in resource-restricted settings where barriers to transmission are lower. Here, we study the flux and genetic diversity of MRSA on ward and individual patient levels in a hospital where transmission was common. We repeatedly screened all patients on two intensive care units for MRSA carriage over a 3-mo period. All MRSA belonged to multilocus sequence type 239 (ST 239). We defined the population structure and charted the spread of MRSA by sequencing 79 isolates from 46 patients and five members of staff, including the first MRSA-positive screen isolates and up to two repeat isolates where available. Phylogenetic analysis identified a flux of distinct ST 239 clades over time in each intensive care unit. In total, five main clades were identified, which varied in the carriage of plasmids encoding antiseptic and antimicrobial resistance determinants. Sequence data confirmed intra- and interwards transmission events and identified individual patients who were colonized by more than one clade. One patient on each unit was the source of numerous transmission events, and deep sampling of one of these cases demonstrated colonization with a ""cloud"" of related MRSA variants. The application of whole-genome sequencing and analysis provides novel insights into the transmission of MRSA in under-resourced healthcare settings and has relevance to wider global health.

Contrary to the perception of ever-growing connectivity, we observe that individuals exhibit a finite communication capacity, which limits the number of ties they can maintain active in time. On average men display higher capacity than women, and this capacity decreases for both genders over their lifespan.

Extracellular signals, mediated by diverse classes of cell-surface receptors, regulate NHE1 activity through distinct signaling networks that converge to directly modify the C-terminal regulatory domain. Modifications in the C-terminus, including phosphorylation and the binding of regulatory proteins, control transport activity by altering the affinity of the TM domain for intracellular H(+). Recently, it was determined that NHE1 also functions as a membrane anchor for the actin-based cytoskeleton, independently of its role in ion translocation.

Suicide prevention training in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is a national health priority in Australia.
OBJECTIVE:
This paper describes a qualitative study to increase understanding of how a mobile application (app) could be used to support suicide prevention gatekeepers in Indigenous communities. We respectfully use the term Indigenous to refer to Australian peoples of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander descent.
METHOD:
Two participatory design workshops were held with 12 participants who were either Indigenous health workers or community members. The workshops first explored what knowledge, skills, and support suicide prevention gatekeepers in Indigenous communities may require, as well as how technology, specifically mobile apps, could be used to support these needs.
RESULTS:
Qualitative analysis identified four themes related to perceptions of who gatekeepers are, their role requirements, technology and supporting resources, as well as broader community issues. Participants thought training programs should target key, accessible, and respected people from diverse, designated, and emergent groups in Indigenous communities to act as gatekeepers, but requested an alternative, more culturally appropriate term to 'gatekeeper' (e.g., responder). Training should prepare gatekeepers for multifaceted suicide prevention roles, including the identification and management of at-risk Indigenous persons, the provision of psychoeducation and ongoing support, as well as facilitate integrated care in collaboration with community services. A combination of multiple support resources was recommended, including multi-platform options in the technology (e.g., mobile applications, social media) and physical domains (e.g., wallet cards, regular meetings). Recommended app features included culturally appropriate refresher content on suicide intervention, training recall, integrated care, how to access gatekeeper peer support, and debriefing. Broader community concerns on gatekeeper support needs were also considered.

1334971,1992,"Accumulated sequence analyses of the antibody repertoire have revealed that most autoantibodies and developmentally regulated antibodies share a small set of germline Ig-variable region (V) genes. The findings have prompted speculation that certain autoantibodies are of developmental importance and may be instrumental in maintaining homeostasis of the adult antibody repertoire. In order to evaluate this hypothesis critically, it is first necessary to determine the V gene usage in human antibodies against foreign substances. Unfortunately, only a few such antibodies have had their heavy and light chains characterized. To rectify the situation, we adapted the anchored polymerase chain reaction to clone and analyze rapidly the expressed V genes for three anti-virus IgG antibodies. The results show that all three heavy chain V (Vh) genes are highly homologous to the known autoantibody-related Vh genes. In contrast, two light chain V (VL) genes of the V lambda 1 subgroup are similar to a non-autoantibody-related germline V lambda 1 gene. Taken together with the reported Vh and VL sequences of several antibodies against viruses and bacteria, the data show that many antipathogen antibodies may use the same small set of Vh genes that encode autoantibodies, but diverse VL genes that are distinct from autoantibody-related VL genes. Thus, only a small portion of the potentially functional germline Vh genes are used recurrently to generate most antibodies in a normal antibody repertoire, regardless of their reactivities with either self or non-self.",1,1,2,0,0

Models of care - evidence-based and context-specific frameworks that aim to deliver the highest quality of care for patients and their families - allow the application of precision and multidisciplinary medicine to FH care and can serve as paradigms for the prevention of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in all at-risk patients and families worldwide. The exponential growth in the number of publications on diverse aspects of FH has provided new knowledge for developing essential elements of existing models of care. These elements include clinical diagnostic criteria and genetic testing; risk restratification strategies; LDL-cholesterol treatment targets; management protocols for children; care of women in pregnancy; use of pharmacotherapies, including ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors; use of lipoprotein apheresis for severe FH; and addressing barriers to care. However, substantial gaps remain that need to be addressed by a broad research agenda, implementation strategies and global collaboration and advocacy, aimed at improving the uptake, cost-effectiveness and routine implementation of evidence-based standards. In this Review, we summarize the dramatic increase in knowledge that informs adaptive models of care, with an emphasis on articles published since 2014.",1,1,4,0,0
25885588,2015,"BACKGROUND:
Inequalities in health are acknowledged in many developed countries, whereby disadvantaged groups systematically suffer from worse health outcomes such as lower life expectancy than non-disadvantaged groups. Engaging members of disadvantaged communities in public health initiatives has been suggested as a way to reduce health inequities. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions that engage the community on a range of health outcomes across diverse health issues.
METHODS:
We searched the following sources for systematic reviews of public health interventions: Cochrane CDSR and CENTRAL, Campbell Library, DARE, NIHR HTA programme website, HTA database, and DoPHER. Through the identified reviews, we collated a database of primary studies that appeared to be relevant, and screened the full-text documents of those primary studies against our inclusion criteria. In parallel, we searched the NHS EED and TRoPHI databases for additional primary studies. For the purposes of these analyses, study design was limited to randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. Only interventions conducted in OECD countries and published since 1990 were included. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of health behaviour, health consequences, self-efficacy, and social support outcomes, and a narrative summary of community outcomes. We tested a range of moderator variables, with a particular emphasis on the model of community engagement used as a potential moderator of intervention effectiveness.
RESULTS:
Of the 9,467 primary studies scanned, we identified 131 for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The overall effect size for health behaviour outcomes is d = .33 (95% CI .26, .40). The interventions were also effective in increasing health consequences (d = .16, 95% CI .06, .27); health behaviour self-efficacy (d = .41, 95% CI .16, .65) and perceived social support (d = .41, 95% CI .23, .65). Although the type of community engagement was not a significant moderator of effect, we identified some trends across studies.
CONCLUSIONS:
There is solid evidence that community engagement interventions have a positive impact on a range of health outcomes across various conditions. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether one particular model of community engagement is more effective than any other.

23594683,2013,"Motor vehicle traffic crashes are the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in the United States, resulting in 33,687 deaths in 2010. Pedestrian travel makes up 10.5% of all trips (i.e., any travel from one address to another) taken in the United States, and pedestrians represent 13% of all motor vehicle traffic-related deaths. To determine traffic-related pedestrian death rates by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, and urbanization level, CDC analyzed 2001-2010 data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). The results of that analysis indicated that the overall, annualized, age-adjusted traffic-related pedestrian death rate was 1.58 deaths per 100,000 population. Persons aged ≥75 years and those categorized as American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) had the highest death rates, and age group differences varied by race/ethnicity. The results suggest that the overall pedestrian death rate could increase with the aging and growing racial/ethnic diversity of the U.S. population. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the number of persons aged ≥75 years will more than double, from approximately 18 million in 2011 (6% of the U.S. population) to 44 million in 2040 (12% of the population); minority racial/ethnic populations are projected to increase from 116 million in 2010 (37% of the population) to 186 million in 2040 (49% of the population).* Strategies to prevent pedestrian deaths should include consideration of the needs of older adults and cultural differences among racial/ethnic populations.",1,1,19,12,12

With genotyped data of the markers, we constructed phylogenies of these populations with both D(A) and D(C) measures and performed a principal component analysis, as well as a clustering analysis by structure. Results showed that we successfully recovered the genetic structure of analyzed populations formed by historical migrations.

20429934,2010,"BACKGROUND:
Genome-wide analysis of sequence divergence among species offers profound insights into the evolutionary processes that shape lineages. When full-genome sequencing is not feasible for a broad comparative study, we propose the use of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in order to identify orthologous genes with high sequence divergence. Here we discuss experimental design, statistical power, success rate, sources of variation and potential confounding factors. We used a spotted PCR product microarray platform from Drosophila melanogaster to assess sequence divergence on a gene-by-gene basis in three fully sequenced heterologous species (D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. yakuba). Because complete genome assemblies are available for these species this study presents a powerful test for the use of aCGH as a tool to measure sequence divergence.
RESULTS:
We found a consistent and linear relationship between hybridization ratio and sequence divergence of the sample to the platform species. At higher levels of sequence divergence (< 92% sequence identity to D. melanogaster) approximately 84% of features had significantly less hybridization to the array in the heterologous species than the platform species, and thus could be identified as ""diverged"". At lower levels of divergence (>or= 97% identity), only 13% of genes were identified as diverged. While approximately 40% of the variation in hybridization ratio can be accounted for by variation in sequence identity of the heterologous sample relative to D. melanogaster, other individual characteristics of the DNA sequences, such as GC content, also contribute to variation in hybridization ratio, as does technical variation.
CONCLUSIONS:
Here we demonstrate that aCGH can accurately be used as a proxy to estimate genome-wide divergence, thus providing an efficient way to evaluate how evolutionary processes and genomic architecture can shape species diversity in non-model systems. Given the increased number of species for which microarray platforms are available, comparative studies can be conducted for many interesting lineages in order to identify highly diverged genes that may be the target of natural selection.

It therefore satisfies the criteria for a tumour-associated antigen and is an ideal target for the immunotherapy of cancer. We report here that 5T4 is strongly expressed on the majority of renal cell carcinomas and therefore this population of patients is suitable for trials of 5T4-targeted therapies. In particular, we have shown that T cells from renal cell carcinoma patients can be genetically modified to kill 5T4 expressing renal cancer cell lines by introduction of a chimeric-signalling protein. This protein consists of a single chain antibody fragment capable of binding antigen directly at the cell surface and then activating the T cell by virtue of a CD3zeta-signalling domain. This is a powerful tool that bypasses a number of mechanisms that allow tumours to escape T-cell killing and can be readily scaled up for clinical use.",1,1,2,0,0

To address unresolved issues with respect to the evolutionary relationships among certain species or genera, we produced novel RNA-Seq data sets for nine different Ixodes species. We combined this new data with 18 data sets obtained from public databases, both for Ixodes and non-Ixodes hard tick species, using soft ticks as an outgroup. We assembled transcriptomes (for 27 species in total), predicted coding sequences and identified single copy orthologues (SCO). Using Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian frameworks, we reconstructed a hard tick phylogeny for the nuclear genome. We also obtained a mitochondrial DNA-based phylogeny using published genome sequences and mitochondrial sequences derived from the new transcriptomes. Our results confirm previous studies showing that the Ixodes genus is monophyletic and clarify the relationships among Ixodes sub-genera. This work provides a baseline for studying the evolutionary history of ticks: we indeed found an unexpected acceleration of substitutions for mitochondrial sequences of Prostriata, and for nuclear and mitochondrial genes of two species of Rhipicephalus, which we relate with patterns of genome architecture and changes of life-cycle, respectively.",1,0,1,0,0

to learn about mobile mammography in the United States.
METHODS:
A survey of 82 questions was designed, pilot tested, and sent to mobile mammography facilities. The questions addressed many aspects of mobile programs, including administrative, financial, equipment, personnel, film processing, quality assurance, and communication of results.
RESULTS:
Of the 367 facilities that were mailed surveys, 159 facilities completed the survey, and 30 (19%) of those had discontinued their mobile programs. Seventy-six of 158 (48%) mobile facilities had performed mobile mammography for 1-5 years, and 69 of 158 (44%) had performed mobile mammography for more than 5 years. Seventy-two of 156 (46%) facilities were hospital-owned, and 25 of 156 (16%) were radiologist-owned. One hundred seven of 159 (67%) mobile facilities performed screening only. One hundred fourteen of 152 (75%) facilities charged +80.00 or less for screening. Mobile facilities averaged 20 examinations per day and served diverse populations. Sixty-seven of 159 (42%) facilities accepted self-referred women. Thirty-one percent of the facilities performed on-board processing. Only 71 of 149 (47%) facilities were financially profitable or breaking even, but 112 of 154 (73%) facilities would undertake a mobile project again.

It is therefore vital to understand the insecticide resistance status of An. sinensis in the region. This study examined the nucleotide diversity of the para-sodium channel and knockdown resistance (kdr) in five field populations of adult An. sinensis mosquitoes collected in Jiangsu province, identifying the L1014F and L1014C substitutions for the first time. Competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of specific allele (cPASA) and polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for resistance diagnosis were developed and validated. Comparing the results with direct sequencing revealed that the PCR-RFLP method was more sensitive and specific whereas the cPASA method was more convenient and suitable. The significant positive correlation between kdr allele frequency and bioassay-based resistance phenotype demonstrates that the frequency of L1014F and L1014C substitutions in the kdr gene provides a useful molecular marker for monitoring beta-cypermethrin resistance in natural populations of An. sinensis. Our results point to the L1014F substitution as the key mutation associated with beta-cypermethrin resistance. The high resistance and mutation frequency detected in the five populations also suggest cross-resistance with other pyrethroids may occur in An. sinensis, highlighting the need for further surveys to map insecticide resistance in China and the adoption of a rational management of insecticide application for resistance management and mosquito vector control.",1,1,2,0,3
23726579,2013,"BACKGROUND:
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has diverse causes and the outcomes can change with renal transplantation, which has the potential to increase quality of life and improve survival. Because transplant recipients usually have comorbid conditions, presurgical assessment, optimization of health status, monitoring, and intraoperative anesthetic management are essential.
OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this study was to evaluate available medical literature concerning presurgical anesthetic assessment and intraoperative and postoperative anesthetic management of patients undergoing renal transplantation. REVIEW CRITERIA: A bibliographic search was made in MEDLINE, OVID, and LILIACS without language or design limits. Available evidence from February 1991 to February 2011 was taken. Articles about anesthesia in renal transplantation were included. Information quality was assessed according to design type with ""Critical Appraisal Skills Program"" (CASP-UK) tools. Epidemiological data in Colombia were obtained from the Social Protection Ministry and FOSYGA (Solidarity and Guarantee Fund) web pages.
RESULTS:
Regarding prognosis, CKD mortality increases with dialysis and with its duration, whereas transplantation reduces it and enhances survival. Recipient mortality, functionality, and graft lifespan are influenced by donor type (immediate diuresis with living donors, P < .05), hydration (60-90 mL/kg), early diuresis (13% mortality rate at 1 year if delayed and reduction of graft lifetime 20%-40%). When comparing diuresis, clearance creatinine, kidney perfusion, and function, there were no significant differences between general and regional anesthesia. Nevertheless, postoperative analgesia was better with epidural anesthesia.
CONCLUSIONS:
Examination of the patient and optimization of the overall health status contributes to graft optimal function and patient survival. Regional anesthesia has better control over postoperative pain, but it has no effect on the prognosis, The intraoperative maintenance of appropriate hydration enhances flux and renal perfusion, which allows early functionality of the graft. This, together with a living donor are considered good prognosis factors, moreover they reduce recipient mortality and improve graft lifetime.

There is growing evidence that the disease-induced physiological changes may influence the PKs and PDs of all drugs used in patients with HF. Therapeutic approaches should consider all factors that might influence the response to treatment and dosage should be tailored to individual patients.

26162077,2015,"Metabolic diversity is an important factor during microbial adaptation to different environments. Among metabolic processes, amino acid biosynthesis has been demonstrated to be relevant for survival for many microbial pathogens, whereas the association between pathogenesis and amino acid uptake and recycling are less well-established. Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen with many habitats. As a result, it faces frequent metabolic shifts and challenges during its life cycle. Here we studied the C. neoformans tryptophan biosynthetic pathway and found that the pathway is essential. RNAi indicated that interruptions in the biosynthetic pathway render strains inviable. However, auxotroph complementation can be partially achieved by tryptophan uptake when a non preferred nitrogen source and lower growth temperature are applied, suggesting that amino acid permeases may be the target of nitrogen catabolism repression (NCR). We used bioinformatics to search for amino acid permeases in the C. neoformans and found eight potential global permeases (AAP1 to AAP8). The transcriptional profile of them revealed that they are subjected to regulatory mechanisms which are known to respond to nutritional status in other fungi, such as (i) quality of nitrogen (Nitrogen Catabolism Repression, NCR) and carbon sources (Carbon Catabolism Repression, CCR), (ii) amino acid availability in the extracellular environment (SPS-sensing) and (iii) nutritional deprivation (Global Amino Acid Control, GAAC). This study shows that C. neoformans has fewer amino acid permeases than other model yeasts, and that these proteins may be subjected to complex regulatory mechanisms. Our data suggest that the C. neoformans tryptophan biosynthetic pathway is an excellent pharmacological target. Furthermore, inhibitors of this pathway cause Cryptococcus growth arrest in vitro.

Autophagy is a process which mediates the sequestration, lysosomal delivery and degradation of proteins and organelles. Studies have shown that trehalose exerts beneficial effects through inducing autophagy in mammalian cells. However, whether trehalose or other saccharides can activate autophagy in keratinocytes is unknown. Here, we found that trehalose treatment increased the LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, acridine orange-stained vacuoles and GFP-LC3B (LC3B protein tagged with green fluorescent protein) puncta in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line, indicating autophagy induction. Trehalose-induced autophagy was also observed in primary keratinocytes and the A431 epidermal cancer cell line. mTOR signalling was not affected by trehalose treatment, suggesting that trehalose induced autophagy through an mTOR-independent pathway. mTOR-independent autophagy induction was also observed in HaCaT and HeLa cells treated with sucrose or raffinose but not in glucose, maltose or sorbitol treated HaCaT cells, indicating that autophagy induction was not a general property of saccharides.

29433498,2018,"BACKGROUND:
Breede Valley is a sub-district of the Cape Winelands district, Western Cape Province, South Africa. The administrative capital of the district is situated in the semi-rural town Worcester. Findings of a baseline survey in Worcester revealed poor infant feeding practices and childhood under- and overnutrition, with particular concern over high levels of stunting and low dietary diversity. Maternal overweight and obesity was high. These characteristics made the site suitable to study multi-sectoral arrangements for infant and young child nutrition (IYCN). The purpose of this study was to explore elements of an enabling environment with key stakeholders aimed at improving IYCN at implementation level.
METHODS:
Focus group discussions and interviews were conducted with representatives from two vulnerable communities; local and district government; higher education institutions; business; and the media in the Breede Valley. Audio recordings were transcribed and data were analysed with the Atlas.TI software programme.
RESULTS:
The participants viewed knowledge and evidence about the first 1000 days of life as important to address IYCN. The impact of early, optimal nutrition on health and intellectual development resonated with them. The IYCN narrative in the Breede Valley could therefore be framed around nutrition's development impact in a well-structured advocacy campaign. Participants felt that capacity and resources were constrained by many competing agendas spreading public resources thinly, leaving limited scope for promotion and prevention activities. ""People"" were viewed as a resource, and building partnerships and relationships, could bridge some shortfalls in capacity. Conversations about politics and governance elicited strong opinions about what should be done through direct intervention, policy formulation and legislation. A lead government agency could not be identified for taking the IYCN agenda forward, due to its complexity. Participants proposed it should be referred to a local, informal, inter-governmental body where directors and senior managers meet to address issues of cross-cutting importance.
CONCLUSION:
The study illustrated that knowledge and evidence; politics and governance; and capacity and resources, elements of the international definition of an enabling environment, also apply at implementation level. In addition, our findings indicated that a people-centred approach is critical in shaping the enabling environment at this level.

23382422,2013,"In the past decade, rapid increases in the availability of high-resolution molecular and epidemiological data, combined with developments in statistical and computational methods to simulate and infer migration patterns, have provided key insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza A viruses in humans. In this review, we contrast findings from epidemiological and molecular studies of influenza virus transmission at different spatial scales. We show that findings are broadly consistent in large-scale studies of inter-regional or inter-hemispheric spread in temperate regions, revealing intense epidemics associated with multiple viral introductions, followed by deep troughs driven by seasonal bottlenecks. However, aspects of the global transmission dynamics of influenza viruses are still debated, especially with respect to the existence of tropical source populations experiencing high levels of genetic diversity and the extent of prolonged viral persistence between epidemics. At the scale of a country or community, epidemiological studies have revealed spatially structured diffusion patterns in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks, which were not identified in molecular studies.

Conversion is a term for treatments that seek to suppress or change a person's sexual orientation or gender. Our review focuses on transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) people. Our aims were to (1) describe the frequency, nature and structure of conversion practices; (2) document difficulties in accessing transition-related healthcare and (3) evaluate the mental health consequences of such practices and access barriers.
METHOD:
Systematic review and narrative synthesis using the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme and Joanne Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Data sources include Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES and Web of Science between 1990 and June 2017.
PARTICIPANTS:
Studies were included that (1) document use of conversion therapies or access barriers to transition-related healthcare; and/or (2) describe how such therapeutic practices and access barriers have been applied and/or (3) evaluate the mental health impacts of such therapies and difficulties accessing transition-related healthcare. Two reviewers screened papers for eligibility. Data were then grouped according to the objectives. Narratives and themes were presented per study.
RESULTS:
Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Four reports were on 'realignment', involving case studies or case series. Two involved psychoanalysis, one self-exposure therapy and one open-ended play psychotherapy. All four studies concerning 'realignment' were of poor methodological quality. The other three studies explored access barriers from the view point of TGD youth, their parents and healthcare providers. All papers reported access barriers, such as inability to access puberty-delaying medications. The papers concerning barriers to access were of good methodological quality.

21248168,2011,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that can occur as the result of numerous different pathophysiological processes in the atria. Some aspects of the morphological and electrophysiological alterations promoting AF have been studied extensively in animal models. Atrial tachycardia or AF itself shortens atrial refractoriness and causes loss of atrial contractility. Aging, neurohumoral activation, and chronic atrial stretch due to structural heart disease activate a variety of signaling pathways leading to histological changes in the atria including myocyte hypertrophy, fibroblast proliferation, and complex alterations of the extracellular matrix including tissue fibrosis. These changes in electrical, contractile, and structural properties of the atria have been called ""atrial remodeling."" The resulting electrophysiological substrate is characterized by shortening of atrial refractoriness and reentrant wavelength or by local conduction heterogeneities caused by disruption of electrical interconnections between muscle bundles. Under these conditions, ectopic activity originating from the pulmonary veins or other sites is more likely to occur and to trigger longer episodes of AF. Many of these alterations also occur in patients with or at risk for AF, although the direct demonstration of these mechanisms is sometimes challenging. The diversity of etiological factors and electrophysiological mechanisms promoting AF in humans hampers the development of more effective therapy of AF. This review aims to give a translational overview on the biological basis of atrial remodeling and the proarrhythmic mechanisms involved in the fibrillation process.

11586952,2001,"BACKGROUND:
The management of urinary tract infections is complicated by the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Escherichia coli. We studied the clonal composition of E. coli isolates that were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole from women with community-acquired urinary tract infections.
METHODS:
Prospectively collected E. coli isolates from women with urinary tract infections in a university community in California were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility, O:H serotype, DNA fingerprinting, pulsed-field gel electrophoretic pattern, and virulence factors. The prevalence and characteristics of an antibiotic-resistant clone were evaluated in this group of isolates and in those from comparison cohorts in Michigan and Minnesota.
RESULTS:
Fifty-five of the 255 E. coli isolates (22 percent) from the California cohort were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as well as other antibiotics. There was a common pattern of DNA fingerprinting, suggesting that the isolates belonged to the same clonal group (clonal group A), in 28 of 55 isolates with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance (51 percent) and in 2 of 50 randomly selected isolates that were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (4 percent, P<0.001). In addition, 11 of 29 resistant isolates (38 percent) from the Michigan cohort and 7 of 18 (39 percent) from the Minnesota cohort belonged to clonal group A. Most of the clonal group A isolates were serotype O11:H(nt) or O77:H(nt), with similar patterns of virulence factors, antibiotic susceptibility, and electrophoretic features.
CONCLUSIONS:
In three geographically diverse communities, a single clonal group accounted for nearly half of community-acquired urinary tract infections in women that were caused by E. coli strains with resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The widespread distribution and high prevalence of E. coli clonal group A has major public health implications.

16183914,2005,"Stimulus-secretion coupling is an essential process in secretory cells in which regulated exocytosis occurs, including neuronal, neuroendocrine, endocrine, and exocrine cells. While an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) is the principal signal, other intracellular signals also are important in regulated exocytosis. In particular, the cAMP signaling system is well known to regulate and modulate exocytosis in a variety of secretory cells. Until recently, it was generally thought that the effects of cAMP in regulated exocytosis are mediated by activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a major cAMP target, followed by phosphorylation of the relevant proteins. Although the involvement of PKA-independent mechanisms has been suggested in cAMP-regulated exocytosis by pharmacological approaches, the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Newly discovered cAMP-GEF/Epac, which belongs to the cAMP-binding protein family, exhibits guanine nucleotide exchange factor activities and exerts diverse effects on cellular functions including hormone/transmitter secretion, cell adhesion, and intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization. cAMP-GEF/Epac mediates the PKA-independent effects on cAMP-regulated exocytosis. Thus cAMP regulates and modulates exocytosis by coordinating both PKA-dependent and PKA-independent mechanisms.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in people over 50 y of age in at least three continents. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the process by which abnormal blood vessels develop underneath the retina. CNV develops in 10% of patients with AMD but accounts for up to 90% of the blindness from AMD. Although the precise etiology of CNV in AMD remains unknown, the macrophage component of the inflammatory response, which has been shown to promote tumor growth and support atherosclerotic plaque formation, is thought to stimulate aberrant angiogenesis in blinding eye diseases. The current theory is that macrophage infiltration promotes the development of neovascularization in CNV.

We examined the role of macrophages in a mouse model of CNV. IL-10(-/-) mice, which have increased inflammation in response to diverse stimuli, have significantly reduced CNV with increased macrophage infiltrates compared to wild type. Prevention of macrophage entry into the eye promoted neovascularization while direct injection of macrophages significantly inhibited CNV. Inhibition by macrophages was mediated by the TNF family death molecule Fas ligand (CD95-ligand).
CONCLUSIONS:
Immune vascular interactions can be highly complex. Normal macrophage function is critical in controlling pathologic neovascularization in the eye. IL-10 regulates macrophage activity in the eye and is an attractive therapeutic target in order to suppress or inhibit CNV in AMD that can otherwise lead to blindness.

20920195,2010,"BACKGROUND:
Oral bacterial communities contain species that promote health and others that have been implicated in oral and/or systemic diseases. Culture-independent approaches provide the best means to assess the diversity of oral bacteria because most of them remain uncultivable.
RESULTS:
The salivary microbiota from five adults was analyzed at three time-points by means of the 454 pyrosequencing technology. The V1-V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes was amplified by PCR using saliva lysates and broad-range primers. The bar-coded PCR products were pooled and sequenced unidirectionally to cover the V3 hypervariable region. Of 50,708 obtained sequences, 31,860 passed the quality control. Non-bacterial sequences (2.2%) were removed leaving 31,170 reads. Samples were dominated by seven major phyla: members of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and candidate division TM7 were identified in all samples; Fusobacteria and Spirochaetes were identified in all individuals, but not at all time-points. The dataset was represented by 3,011 distinct sequences (100%-ID phylotypes) of ~215 nucleotides and 583 phylotypes defined at ≥97% identity (97%-ID phylotypes). We compared saliva samples from different individuals in terms of the phylogeny of their microbial communities. Based on the presence and absence of phylotypes defined at 100% or 97% identity thresholds, samples from each subject formed separate clusters. Among individual taxa, phylum Bacteroidetes and order Clostridiales (Firmicutes) were the best indicators of intraindividual similarity of the salivary flora over time. Fifteen out of 81 genera constituted 73 to 94% of the total sequences present in different samples. Of these, 8 were shared by all time points of all individuals, while 15-25 genera were present in all three time-points of different individuals. Representatives of the class Sphingobacteria, order Sphingobacteriales and family Clostridiaceae were found only in one subject.
CONCLUSIONS:
The salivary microbial community appeared to be stable over at least 5 days, allowing for subject-specific grouping using UniFrac. Inclusion of all available samples from more distant time points (up to 29 days) confirmed this observation. Samples taken at closer time intervals were not necessarily more similar than samples obtained across longer sampling times. These results point to the persistence of subject-specific taxa whose frequency fluctuates between the time points. Genus Gemella, identified in all time-points of all individuals, was not defined as a core-microbiome genus in previous studies of salivary bacterial communities. Human oral microbiome studies are still in their infancy and larger-scale projects are required to better define individual and universal oral microbiome core.

16148929,2005,"Colloidal suspensions are widely used to study processes such as melting, freezing and glass transitions. This is because they display the same phase behaviour as atoms or molecules, with the nano- to micrometre size of the colloidal particles making it possible to observe them directly in real space. Another attractive feature is that different types of colloidal interactions, such as long-range repulsive, short-range attractive, hard-sphere-like and dipolar, can be realized and give rise to equilibrium phases. However, spherically symmetric, long-range attractions (that is, ionic interactions) have so far always resulted in irreversible colloidal aggregation. Here we show that the electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged particles can be tuned such that large ionic colloidal crystals form readily, with our theory and simulations confirming the stability of these structures. We find that in contrast to atomic systems, the stoichiometry of our colloidal crystals is not dictated by charge neutrality; this allows us to obtain a remarkable diversity of new binary structures. An external electric field melts the crystals, confirming that the constituent particles are indeed oppositely charged. Colloidal model systems can thus be used to study the phase behaviour of ionic species. We also expect that our approach to controlling opposite-charge interactions will facilitate the production of binary crystals of micrometre-sized particles, which could find use as advanced materials for photonic applications.",1,0,1,0,0
19011614,2008,"Pentraxins are a family of ancient innate immune mediators conserved throughout evolution. The classical pentraxins include serum amyloid P component (SAP) and C-reactive protein, which are two of the acute-phase proteins synthesized in response to infection. Both recognize microbial pathogens and activate the classical complement pathway through C1q (refs 3 and 4). More recently, members of the pentraxin family were found to interact with cell-surface Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR) and activate leukocyte-mediated phagocytosis. Here we describe the structural mechanism for pentraxin's binding to FcgammaR and its functional activation of FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. The complex structure between human SAP and FcgammaRIIa reveals a diagonally bound receptor on each SAP pentamer with both D1 and D2 domains of the receptor contacting the ridge helices from two SAP subunits. The 1:1 stoichiometry between SAP and FcgammaRIIa infers the requirement for multivalent pathogen binding for receptor aggregation. Mutational and binding studies show that pentraxins are diverse in their binding specificity for FcgammaR isoforms but conserved in their recognition structure. The shared binding site for SAP and IgG results in competition for FcgammaR binding and the inhibition of immune-complex-mediated phagocytosis by soluble pentraxins. These results establish antibody-like functions for pentraxins in the FcgammaR pathway, suggest an evolutionary overlap between the innate and adaptive immune systems, and have new therapeutic implications for autoimmune diseases.",1,0,1,0,0

31311966,2019,"The fluidic force microscope (FluidFM) can be considered as the nanofluidic extension of the atomic force microscope (AFM). This novel instrument facilitates the experimental procedure and data acquisition of force spectroscopy (FS) and is also used for the determination of single-cell adhesion forces (SCFS) and elasticity. FluidFM uses special probes with an integrated nanochannel inside the cantilevers supported by parallel rows of pillars. However, little is known about how the properties of these hollow cantilevers affect the most important parameters which directly scale the obtained spectroscopic data: the inverse optical lever sensitivity (InvOLS) and the spring constant (k). The precise determination of these parameters during calibration is essential in order to gain reliable, comparable and consistent results with SCFS. Demonstrated by our literature survey, the standard error of previously published SCFS results obtained with FluidFM ranges from 11.8% to 50%. The question arises whether this can be accounted for biological diversity or may be the consequence of improper calibration. Thus the aim of our work was to investigate the calibration accuracy of these parameters and their dependence on: (1) the aperture size (2, 4 and 8 µm) of the hollow micropipette type cantilever; (2) the position of the laser spot on the back of the cantilever; (3) the substrate used for calibration (silicon or polystyrene). It was found that both the obtained InvOLS and spring constant values depend significantly on the position of the laser spot. Apart from the theoretically expectable monotonous increase in InvOLS (from the tip to the base of the cantilever, as functions of the laser spot's position), we discerned a well-defined and reproducible fluctuation, which can be as high as ±30%, regardless of the used aperture size or substrate. The calibration of spring constant also showed an error in the range of -13/+20%, measured at the first 40 µm of the cantilever. Based on our results a calibration strategy is proposed and the optimal laser position which yields the most reliable spring constant values was determined and found to be on the first pair of pillars. Our proposed method helps in reducing the error introduced via improper calibration and thus increases the reliability of subsequent cell adhesion force or elasticity measurements with FluidFM.",1,0,1,0,0

The use of adult stem/progenitor cells endowed with a high self-renewal ability and multilineage differentiation potential, which are able to regenerate all the mature cells in the tissues from their origin, offers great promise in replacing non-functioning or lost cells and regenerating diseased and damaged tissues. The presence of a small subpopulation of adult stem/progenitor cells in most tissues and organs provides the possibility of stimulating their in vivo differentiation, or of using their ex vivo expanded progenies for cell-replacement and gene therapies with multiple applications in humans without a high-risk of graft rejection and major side effects. Among the diseases that could be treated by adult stem cell-based therapies are hematopoietic and immune disorders, multiple degenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, Types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus as well as skin, eye, liver, lung, tooth and cardiovascular disorders. In addition, a combination of the current cancer treatments with an adjuvant treatment consisting of an autologous or allogeneic adult stem/progenitor cell transplantation also represents a promising strategy for treating and even curing diverse aggressive, metastatic, recurrent and lethal cancers.

21569389,2011,"BACKGROUND:
Resistance of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) cultivars to populations of cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines I.) was complicated by the diversity of HG Types (biotypes), the multigenic nature of resistance and the temperature dependence of resistance to biotypes. The objective here was to identify QTL for broad-spectrum resistance to SCN and examine the transcript abundances of some genes within the QTL.
RESULTS:
A Total of 140 F(5) derived F(7) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were advanced by single-seed-descent from a cross between 'L-10' (a soybean cultivar broadly resistant to SCN) and 'Heinong 37' (a SCN susceptible cultivar). Associated QTL were identified by WinQTL2.1. QTL Qscn3-1 on linkage group (LG) E, Qscn3-2 on LG G, Qscn3-3 on LG J and Qscn14-1 on LG O were associated with SCN resistance in both year data (2007 and 2008). Qscn14-2 on LG O was identified to be associated with SCN resistance in 2007. Qscn14-3 on LG D2 was identified to be associated with SCN resistance in 2008. Qscn14-4 on LG J was identified to be associated with SCN resistance in 2008. The Qscn3-2 on LG G was linked to Satt309 (less than 4 cM), and explained 19.7% and 23.4% of the phenotypic variation in 2007 and 2008 respectively. Qscn3-3 was less than 5 cM from Satt244 on LG J, and explained 19.3% and 17.95% of the phenotypic variations in 2007 and 2008 respectively. Qscn14-4 could explain 12.6% of the phenotypic variation for the SCN race 14 resistance in 2008 and was located in the same region as Qscn3-3. The total phenotypic variation explained by Qscn3-2 and Qscn3-3 together was 39.0% and 41.3% in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Further, the flanking markers Satt275, Satt309, Sat_350 and Satt244 were used for the selection of resistant lines to SCN race 3, and the accuracy of selection was about 73% in this RIL population. Four genes in the predicted resistance gene cluster of LG J (chromosome 16) were successfully cloned by RT-PCR. The transcript encoded by the gene Glyma16g30760.1 was abundant in the SCN resistant cultivar 'L-10' but absent in susceptible cultivar 'Heinong 37'. Further, the abundance was higher in root than in leaf for 'L-10'. Therefore, the gene was a strong candidate to underlie part of the resistance to SCN.
CONCLUSIONS:
Satt275, Satt309, Sat_305 and Satt244, which were tightly linked to the major QTL for resistance to SCN on LG G and J, would be candidates for marker-assisted selection of lines resistant to the SCN race 3. Among the six RLK genes, Glyma16g30760.1 was found to accumulate transcripts in the SCN resistance cultivar 'L-10' but not in 'Heinong 37'. The transcript abundance was higher in root than in leaf for L-10.

We now report that CD13 (aminopeptidase N) can associate with TAL6 and can enhance cancer cell migration. CD13 was shown by coimmunoprecipitation to associate in vitro with TAL6 on several cancer cell lines and to associate in vivo by antibody-mediated copatching immunofluorescence. CD13 was selectively expressed on highly invasive CL1-5 lung cancer cells as compared to poorly invasive CL1-0 lung cancer cells. The role of CD13 aminopeptidase activity in regulating cell motility was investigated with chemical inhibitors, specific antibodies and a catalytically inactive CD13 protein. Inhibition of CD13 aminopeptidase activity by nontoxic concentrations of leuhistin modestly decreased the migration of CL1-5 cells. In contrast, binding of CD13 by specific antibodies significantly reduced both the migration and the invasion of CL1-5 cells. Poorly invasive CL1-0 cells that stably expressed CD13 displayed significantly (p < or = 0.0005) enhanced cell migration (300% of control). Expression of an enzymatically inactive CD13 mutant on CL1-0 cells also significantly (p < or = 0.0005) enhanced cell migration (200% of control).

To explore associations among twenty formal and informal, societal and individual-level factors and quality of life (QOL) among people living with congestive heart failure (CHF) in two settings with different healthcare and social care systems and sociocultural contexts.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:
We recruited 367 adult patients with CHF from a single heart failure clinic within two countries with different national social to healthcare spending ratios: Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States (US), and Nijmegen, Netherlands (NL).
DESIGN:
Cross-sectional survey study. We adapted the Social Quality Model (SQM) to organize twenty diverse factors into four categories: Living Conditions (formal-societal: e.g., housing, education), Social Embeddedness (informal-societal: e.g., social support, trust), Societal Embeddedness (formal-individual: e.g., access to care, legal aid), and Self-Regulation (informal-individual: e.g., physical health, resilience). We developed a survey comprising validated instruments to assess each factor. We administered the survey in-person or by mail between March 2017 and August 2018.
OUTCOMES:
We used Cantril's Self-Anchoring Scale to assess overall QOL. We used backwards stepwise regression to identify factors within each SQM category that were independently associated with QOL among US and NL participants (p<0.05). We then identified factors independently associated with QOL across all categories (p<0.05).
RESULTS:
367 CHF patients from the US (32%) and NL (68%) participated. Among US participants, financial status, receiving legal aid or housing assistance, and resilience were associated with QOL, and together explained 49% of the variance in QOL; among NL participants, financial status, perceived physical health, independence in activities of daily living, and resilience were associated with QOL, and explained 53% of the variance in QOL.
CONCLUSIONS:
Four formal and informal factors explained approximately half of the variance in QOL among patients with CHF in the US and NL.

We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of 31 cohorts (N=53,949) in which the participants had undertaken multiple, diverse cognitive tests. A general cognitive function phenotype was tested for, and created in each cohort by principal component analysis. We report 13 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations in three genomic regions, 6q16.1, 14q12 and 19q13.32 (best SNP and closest gene, respectively: rs10457441, P=3.93 × 10(-9), MIR2113; rs17522122, P=2.55 × 10(-8), AKAP6; rs10119, P=5.67 × 10(-9), APOE/TOMM40).

7751180,1995,"OBJECTIVE:
At present, the linear-quadratic model for cellular response to radiation can incorporate sublethal damage repair and repopulation. We suggest an extension, termed LQR, to include also the other two ""Rs"" of radiobiology, cell cycle redistribution, and reoxygenation.
METHODS:
In this approach, redistribution and reoxygenation are both regarded as aspects of a single phenomenon, which we term resensitization. After the first portion of a radiation exposure has decreased the average radiosensitivity of a diverse cell population by preferentially sparing less sensitive cells, resensitization gradually restores the average sensitivity of the population towards its previous value. The proposed LQR formula is of the same form as the original LQ formula, but with two extra parameters, an overall resensitization magnitude and a characteristic resensitization time. The LQR model assumes that resensitization is monotonic rather than oscillatory in time, i.e., always tends to increase average cellular sensitivity as overall time increases. We argue that this monotonicity assumption is likely to hold in clinical situations, though a possible extension is discussed to account for oscillatory decay of resensitization effects.
RESULTS:
The LQR model gives reasonable fits to relevant experimental data in the literature, reproducing an initial rise in cell survival, due to repair, as the treatment time is increased, followed by a resensitization-related decrease in survival due to redistribution and/or reoxygenation for treatment times of the order of the cell cycle time, and a final survival increase due to repopulation as the treatment time is increased still further.
CONCLUSIONS:
The LQR model is a simple and potentially useful extension of the LQ model for computing more realistic isoeffect relations for early responding tissues, including tumors, when comparing different radiotherapeutic protocols.

20400944,2010,"GABA(B) receptors are the G-protein-coupled receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. They are expressed in almost all neurons of the brain, where they regulate synaptic transmission and signal propagation by controlling the activity of voltage-gated calcium (Ca(v)) and inward-rectifier potassium (K(ir)) channels. Molecular cloning revealed that functional GABA(B) receptors are formed by the heteromeric assembly of GABA(B1) with GABA(B2) subunits. However, cloned GABA(B(1,2)) receptors failed to reproduce the functional diversity observed with native GABA(B) receptors. Here we show by functional proteomics that GABA(B) receptors in the brain are high-molecular-mass complexes of GABA(B1), GABA(B2) and members of a subfamily of the KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing) proteins. KCTD proteins 8, 12, 12b and 16 show distinct expression profiles in the brain and associate tightly with the carboxy terminus of GABA(B2) as tetramers. This co-assembly changes the properties of the GABA(B(1,2)) core receptor: the KCTD proteins increase agonist potency and markedly alter the G-protein signalling of the receptors by accelerating onset and promoting desensitization in a KCTD-subtype-specific manner.

21415127,2011,"A significant challenge for neuroscientists is to determine how both electrical and chemical signals affect the activity of cells and circuits and how the nervous system subsequently translates that activity into behavior. Remote, bidirectional manipulation of those signals with high spatiotemporal precision is an ideal approach to addressing that challenge. Neuroscientists have recently developed a diverse set of tools that permit such experimental manipulation with varying degrees of spatial, temporal, and directional control. These tools use light, peptides, and small molecules to primarily activate ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that in turn activate or inhibit neuronal firing. By monitoring the electrophysiological, biochemical, and behavioral effects of such activation/inhibition, researchers can better understand the links between brain activity and behavior. Here, we review the tools that are available for this type of experimentation. We describe the development of the tools and highlight exciting in vivo data. We focus primarily on designer GPCRs (receptors activated solely by synthetic ligands, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) and microbial opsins (e.g., channelrhodopsin-2, halorhodopsin, Volvox carteri channelrhodopsin) but also describe other novel techniques that use orthogonal receptors, caged ligands, allosteric modulators, and other approaches. These tools differ in the direction of their effect (activation/inhibition, hyperpolarization/depolarization), their onset and offset kinetics (milliseconds/minutes/hours), the degree of spatial resolution they afford, and their invasiveness.

15169681,2004,"OBJECTIVE:
This article explores the potential of community intervention perspectives for increasing the relevance, reach, and public health impact of mental health services research.
METHODS:
The authors reviewed community intervention strategies, including public health and community development and empowerment interventions, and contrast community intervention with practice-based quality improvement and policy research.
RESULTS:
A model was proposed to integrate health services and community intervention research, building on the evidence-based strength of quality improvement and participatory methods of community intervention to produce complementary functions, such as linking community-based case finding and referral with practice-based quality improvement, enhanced by community-based social support for treatment adherence.
CONCLUSIONS:
The community intervention approach is a major paradigm for affecting public health or addressing health disparities. Despite challenges in implementation and evaluation, it represents a promising approach for extending the reach of mental health services interventions into diverse communities.

20956011,2010,"The cross-species transmission of retroviruses is limited by host restriction factors that exhibit inter-species diversity. For example, the TRIM5α proteins of Old World monkeys block the early, post-entry steps in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. We adapted an HIV-1 isolate to replicate in cells expressing TRIM5α(rh) from rhesus monkeys, an Old World species. A single amino acid change in the cyclophilin-binding loop of the HIV-1 capsid protein allowed virus replication in cells expressing TRIM5α(rh). The capsid of the escape virus exhibited a reduced affinity for TRIM5α(rh), but retained the ability to bind cyclophilin A efficiently. Thus, a preferred HIV-1 escape pathway involves decreased binding to TRIM5α, a capsid-destabilizing factor, and retention of binding to cyclophilin A, a capsid-stabilizing factor.",1,1,3,0,0

11593395,2001,"Chk2 is a transducer of DNA damage signals and a tumour suppressor whose germ-line mutations predispose to diverse tumour types. Unlike its downstream targets such as the p53 tumour suppressor, the expression patterns of Chk2 in tissues and tumours remain unknown. As DNA breaks occur commonly during gametogenesis, and p53 is wild-type and overexpressed in testicular cancer, we examined abundance and localisation of the Chk2 protein during normal development of human testes, and at various stages of germ-cell tumour (GCT) pathogenesis. Our results show that Chk2 is abundant in foetal germ cells and adult spermatogonia, yet only weakly expressed or lacking during the meiotic and later stages of spermatogenesis. High levels of Chk2 are detected in the majority of GCTs including all pre-invasive carcinoma-in-situ lesions, contrary to variable expression and even lack of Chk2 in subsets of invasive GCTs and some teratoma structures, respectively. Together with our analyses of cell culture models, these results indicate that downmodulation or lack of Chk2 is not simply attributable to quiescence or differentiation, they suggest a role for Chk2 in mitotic rather than meiotic divisions, support the concept of foetal origin of GCTs, and have implications for protein-based screening for tumour-associated aberrations of Chk2.",1,1,2,0,0

23671071,2013,"Global food security requires eco-efficient agriculture to produce the required food and fiber products concomitant with ecologically efficient use of resources. This eco-efficiency concept is used to diagnose the state of agricultural production in China (irrigated wheat-maize double-cropping systems), Zimbabwe (rainfed maize systems), and Australia (rainfed wheat systems). More than 3,000 surveyed crop yields in these three countries were compared against simulated grain yields at farmer-specified levels of nitrogen (N) input. Many Australian commercial wheat farmers are both close to existing production frontiers and gain little prospective return from increasing their N input. Significant losses of N from their systems, either as nitrous oxide emissions or as nitrate leached from the soil profile, are infrequent and at low intensities relative to their level of grain production. These Australian farmers operate close to eco-efficient frontiers in regard to N, and so innovations in technologies and practices are essential to increasing their production without added economic or environmental risks. In contrast, many Chinese farmers can reduce N input without sacrificing production through more efficient use of their fertilizer input. In fact, there are real prospects for the double-cropping systems on the North China Plain to achieve both production increases and reduced environmental risks. Zimbabwean farmers have the opportunity for significant production increases by both improving their technical efficiency and increasing their level of input; however, doing so will require improved management expertise and greater access to institutional support for addressing the higher risks. This paper shows that pathways for achieving improved eco-efficiency will differ among diverse cropping systems.",1,0,1,0,9
21643007,2011,"HAMLET is the first member of a new family of tumoricidal protein-lipid complexes that kill cancer cells broadly, while sparing healthy, differentiated cells. Many and diverse tumor cell types are sensitive to the lethal effect, suggesting that HAMLET identifies and activates conserved death pathways in cancer cells. Here, we investigated the molecular basis for the difference in sensitivity between cancer cells and healthy cells. Using a combination of small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibition, proteomic and metabolomic technology, we identified the c-Myc oncogene as one essential determinant of HAMLET sensitivity. Increased c-Myc expression levels promoted sensitivity to HAMLET and shRNA knockdown of c-Myc suppressed the lethal response, suggesting that oncogenic transformation with c-Myc creates a HAMLET-sensitive phenotype. Furthermore, HAMLET sensitivity was modified by the glycolytic state of tumor cells. Glucose deprivation sensitized tumor cells to HAMLET-induced cell death and in the shRNA screen, hexokinase 1 (HK1), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 1 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α modified HAMLET sensitivity. HK1 was shown to bind HAMLET in a protein array containing ∼8000 targets, and HK activity decreased within 15 min of HAMLET treatment, before morphological signs of tumor cell death. In parallel, HAMLET triggered rapid metabolic paralysis in carcinoma cells. Tumor cells were also shown to contain large amounts of oleic acid and its derivatives already after 15 min. The results identify HAMLET as a novel anti-cancer agent that kills tumor cells by exploiting unifying features of cancer cells such as oncogene addiction or the Warburg effect.",1,0,1,0,0
24727533,2014,"Transgender and gender nonconforming people face stigma and discrimination from a wide variety of sources and through numerous social realms. Stigma and discrimination originating from biomedicine and health care provision may impact this group's access to primary care. Such stigma and discrimination may originate not only from direct events and past negative experiences, but also through medicine's role in providing treatments of transitioning, the development of formal diagnoses to provide access to such treatments, and the medical language used to describe this diverse group. This paper examines the postponement of primary curative care among this marginalized group of people by drawing from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, one of the largest available datasets for this underserved group. This paper also proposes an innovate categorization system to account for differences in self-conceptualization and identity, which has been of considerable concern for transgender and gender nonconforming communities but remains underexplored in social and health research. Results suggest that experience, identity, state of transition, and disclosure of transgender or gender nonconforming status are associated with postponement due to discrimination. Other findings suggest that postponement associated with primary place of seeking care and health insurance has ties to both discrimination and affordability. These findings highlight the importance of combating stigma and discrimination generated from within or experienced at sites of biomedicine or health care provision in improving access to care for this group of people. Improving access to care for all gender variant people requires a critical evaluation of existing research practices and health care provision to ensure that care is tailored as needed to each person's perspective in relation to larger social processes.

22161398,2011,"BACKGROUND:
This is an update of a 2008 Cochrane review. Breastfeeding is important. However, not all infants can feed at the breast and methods of expressing milk need evaluation.
OBJECTIVE:
To assess acceptability, effectiveness, safety, effect on composition, contamination and cost implications of methods of milk expression.
METHODS:
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (20 January 2011), CINAHL (1982 to January 2011), conference proceedings, secondary references and contacted researchers.
METHODS:
Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing methods at any time after birth, and crossover trials commencing at least 28 days after birth.
METHODS:
Three authors independently assessed trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy.
RESULTS:
We included 23 studies with 10 studies (632 mothers) providing data for analysis.Mothers provided with a relaxation tape produced more milk than mothers who were not (mean difference (MD) 34.70 ml/single expression, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.51 to 59.89, P = 0.007). A lower milk volume over six days was reported when comparing hand expression to the electric pump (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.00 ml, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.36, P = 0.002); other studies of the same pump using different measures did not find a significant difference (12 to 36 hours postpartum SMD -0.38 cc, 95% CI -0.86 to 0.10, P = 0.12); day five postpartum SMD -0.62 ml/day, 95% CI -1.43 to 0.19, P = 0.13). No evidence of difference in volume was found with simultaneous or sequential pumping, or between manual and electric pumps studied. One study reported a higher sodium concentration in hand expressed milk compared to a manual pump (SMD 0.59 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96, P = 0.002) and to an electric pump (SMD 0.70 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.09, P = 0.0003), and lower potassium concentration compared to a manual pump (MD -0.37 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.73, P = 0.05) or to an electric pump (SMD -0.32 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.06, P = 0.10). No evidence of difference was found for energy content, milk contamination or adverse effects. Reports of maternal views were not comparable. Economic aspects were not reported.  
CONCLUSIONS:
The most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. Low cost interventions including early initiation when not feeding at the breast, relaxation, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. Small sample sizes, large standard deviations, small number of studies reviewed, and the diversity of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the specific settings.

20140188,2010,"Wing patterning in Heliconius butterflies is a longstanding example of both Müllerian mimicry and phenotypic radiation under strong natural selection. The loci controlling such patterns are ""hotspots"" for adaptive evolution with great allelic diversity across different species in the genus. We characterise nucleotide variation, genotype-by-phenotype associations, linkage disequilibrium, and candidate gene expression at two loci and across multiple hybrid zones in Heliconius melpomene and relatives. Alleles at HmB control the presence or absence of the red forewing band, while alleles at HmYb control the yellow hindwing bar. Across HmYb two regions, separated by approximately 100 kb, show significant genotype-by-phenotype associations that are replicated across independent hybrid zones. In contrast, at HmB a single peak of association indicates the likely position of functional sites at three genes, encoding a kinesin, a G-protein coupled receptor, and an mRNA splicing factor. At both HmYb and HmB there is evidence for enhanced linkage disequilibrium (LD) between associated sites separated by up to 14 kb, suggesting that multiple sites are under selection. However, there was no evidence for reduced variation or deviations from neutrality that might indicate a recent selective sweep, consistent with these alleles being relatively old. Of the three genes showing an association with the HmB locus, the kinesin shows differences in wing disc expression between races that are replicated in the co-mimic, Heliconius erato, providing striking evidence for parallel changes in gene expression between Müllerian co-mimics. Wing patterning loci in Heliconius melpomene therefore show a haplotype structure maintained by selection, but no evidence for a recent selective sweep. The complex genetic pattern contrasts with the simple genetic basis of many adaptive traits studied previously, but may provide a better model for most adaptation in natural populations that has arisen over millions rather than tens of years.",1,1,3,1,0
12689978,2003,"OBJECTIVE:
To assess the effect of ethnicity on student performance in stations assessing communication skills within an objective structured clinical examination.
METHODS:
Quantitative and qualitative study.
METHODS:
A final UK clinical examination consisting of a two day objective structured clinical examination with 22 stations.
METHODS:
82 students from ethnic minorities and 97 white students.
METHODS:
Mean scores for stations (quantitative) and observations made using discourse analysis on selected communication stations (qualitative).
RESULTS:
Mean performance of students from ethnic minorities was significantly lower than that of white students for stations assessing communication skills on days 1 (67.0% (SD 6.8%) and 72.3% (7.6%); P=0.001) and 2 (65.2% (6.6%) and 69.5% (6.3%); P=0.003). No examples of overt discrimination were found in 309 video recordings. Transcriptions showed subtle differences in communication styles in some students from ethnic minorities who performed poorly. Examiners' assumptions about what is good communication may have contributed to differences in grading.
CONCLUSIONS:
There was no evidence of explicit discrimination between students from ethnic minorities and white students in the objective structured clinical examination. A small group of male students from ethnic minorities used particularly poorly rated communicative styles, and some subtle problems in assessing communication skills may have introduced bias. Tests need to reflect issues of diversity to ensure that students from ethnic minorities are not disadvantaged.

23071584,2012,"The ranking of scores of individual chemicals within a large screening library is a crucial step in virtual screening (VS) for drug discovery. Previous studies showed that the quality of protein-ligand recognition can be improved using spectrum properties and the shape of the binding energy landscape. Here, we investigate whether the energy gap, defined as the difference between the lowest energy pose generated by a docking experiment and the average energy of all other generated poses and inferred to be a measure of the binding energy landscape sharpness, can improve the separation power between true binders and decoys with respect to the use of the best docking score. We performed retrospective single- and multiple-receptor conformation VS experiments in a diverse benchmark of 40 domains from 38 therapeutically relevant protein targets. Also, we tested the performance of the energy gap on 36 protein targets from the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). The results indicate that the energy gap outperforms the best docking score in its ability to discriminate between true binders and decoys, and true binders tend to have larger energy gaps than decoys. Furthermore, we used the energy gap as a descriptor to measure the height of the native binding phase and obtained a significant increase in the success rate of near native binding pose identification when the ligand binding conformations within the boundaries of the native binding phase were considered. The performance of the energy gap was also evaluated on an independent test case of VS-identified PKR-like ER-localized eIF2α kinase (PERK) inhibitors. We found that the energy gap was superior to the best docking score in its ability to more highly rank active compounds from inactive ones.

25061141,2014,"OBJECTIVE:
Approximately one-third of the adult U.S. population has the metabolic syndrome. Its prevalence is the highest among Hispanic adults, but variation by Hispanic/Latino background is unknown. Our objective was to quantify the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among men and women 18-74 years of age of diverse Hispanic/Latino background.
METHODS:
Two-stage area probability sample of households in four U.S. locales, yielding 16,319 adults (52% women) who self-identified as Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Central American, or South American. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 2009 Joint Scientific Statement. The main outcome measures were age-standardized prevalence of the metabolic syndrome per the harmonized American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute definition and its component abnormalities.
RESULTS:
The metabolic syndrome was present in 36% of women and 34% of men. Differences in the age-standardized prevalence were seen by age, sex, and Hispanic/Latino background. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among those 18-44, 45-64, and 65-74 years of age was 23%, 50%, and 62%, respectively, among women; and 25%, 43%, and 55%, respectively, among men. Among women, the metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 27% in South Americans to 41% in Puerto Ricans. Among men, prevalences ranged from 27% in South Americans to 35% in Cubans. In those with the metabolic syndrome, abdominal obesity was present in 96% of the women compared with 73% of the men; more men (73%) than women (62%) had hyperglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS:
The burden of cardiometabolic abnormalities is high in Hispanic/Latinos but varies by age, sex, and Hispanic/Latino background. Hispanics/Latinos are thus at increased, but modifiable, predicted lifetime risk of diabetes and its cardiovascular sequelae.

Genetic polymorphisms and social factors (alcohol consumption, betel quid (BQ) usage, and cigarette consumption), both separately or jointly, play a crucial role in the occurrence of oral malignant disorders such as oral and pharyngeal cancers and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS:
Simultaneous analyses of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and environmental effects on oral malignant disorders are essential to examine, albeit challenging. Thus, we conducted a case-control study (N = 576) to analyze the risk of occurrence of oral malignant disorders by using binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) with an odds ratio (OR)-based method.
RESULTS:
We demonstrated that a combination of SNPs (CYP26B1 rs887844 and CYP26C1 rs12256889) and socio-demographic factors (age, ethnicity, and BQ chewing), referred to as the combined effects of SNP-environment, correlated with maximal risk diversity of occurrence observed between the oral malignant disorder group and the control group. The risks were more prominent in the oral and pharyngeal cancers group (OR = 10.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.58-23.15) than in the OPMD group (OR = 5.42; 95% CI = 1.94-15.12).
CONCLUSIONS:
Simulation-based ""SNP-environment barcodes"" may be used to predict the risk of occurrence of oral malignant disorders. Applying simulation-based ""SNP-environment barcodes"" may provide insight into the importance of screening tests in preventing oral and pharyngeal cancers and OPMD.

Within individual cells, we correlate the cellular phenotype, in terms of host protein and RNA expression, with stages of the viral life cycle defined by combinatorial expression of viral RNAs. Spliced RNA+ infected cells display multiple memory and activation phenotypes, indicating virus production by diverse CD4 T cell subsets. In most (but not all) cells, progressive infection accompanies post-transcriptional downregulation of CD4 protein, while surface MHC class I is largely retained.

25760649,2015,"To address possible cell-to-cell heterogeneity in growth dynamics of isogenic cell populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we developed a millifluidic drop-based device that not only allows the analysis of populations grown from single cells over periods of a week, but is also able to sort and collect drops of interest, containing viable and healthy cells, which can be used for further experimentation. In this study, we used isogenic algal cells that were first synchronized in mixotrophic growth conditions. We show that these synchronized cells, when placed in droplets and kept in mixotrophic growth conditions, exhibit mostly homogeneous growth statistics, but with two distinct subpopulations: a major population with a short doubling-time (fast-growers) and a significant subpopulation of slowly dividing cells (slow-growers). These observations suggest that algal cells from an isogenic population may be present in either of two states, a state of restricted division and a state of active division. When isogenic cells were allowed to propagate for about 1000 generations on solid agar plates, they displayed an increased heterogeneity in their growth dynamics. Although we could still identify the original populations of slow- and fast-growers, drops inoculated with a single progenitor cell now displayed a wider diversity of doubling-times. Moreover, populations dividing with the same growth-rate often reached different cell numbers in stationary phase, suggesting that the progenitor cells differed in the number of cell divisions they could undertake. We discuss possible explanations for these cell-to-cell heterogeneities in growth dynamics, such as mutations, differential aging or stochastic variations in metabolites and macromolecules yielding molecular switches, in the light of single-cell heterogeneities that have been reported among isogenic populations of other eu- and prokaryotes.

This study aimed to examine the incidence and survival of lung cancer patients from several different ethnic groups in a large ethnically diverse population in the United Kingdom.
METHODS:
Data on residents of South East England diagnosed with lung cancer between 1998 and 2003 were extracted from the Thames Cancer Registry database. Age- and socioeconomic deprivation-standardised incidence rate ratios were calculated for males and females in each ethnic group. Overall survival was examined using Cox regression, adjusted for age, socioeconomic deprivation, stage of disease and treatment. Results are presented for White, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black Caribbean, Black African and Chinese patients, apart from female survival results where only the White, South Asian and Black ethnic groups were analysed.
RESULTS:
Compared with other ethnic groups of the same sex, Bangladeshi men, White men and White women had the highest incidence rates. Bangladeshi men had consistently higher survival estimates compared with White men (fully adjusted hazard ratio 0.46; P<0.001). Indian (0.84; P=0.048), Black Caribbean (0.87; P=0.47) and Black African (0.68; P=0.007) men also had higher survival estimates. South Asian (0.73; P=0.006) and Black (0.74; P=0.004) women had higher survival than White women.

At least three species of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) cause tick-borne Lyme disease. Previous work including the genome analysis of B. burgdorferi B31 and B. garinii PBi suggested a highly variable plasmid part. The frequent occurrence of duplicated sequence stretches, the observed plasmid redundancy, as well as the mainly unknown function and variability of plasmid encoded genes rendered the relationships between plasmids within and between species largely unresolvable.
RESULTS:
To gain further insight into Borreliae genome properties we completed the plasmid sequences of B. garinii PBi, added the genome of a further species, B. afzelii PKo, to our analysis, and compared for both species the genomes of pathogenic and apathogenic strains. The core of all Bbsl genomes consists of the chromosome and two plasmids collinear between all species. We also found additional groups of plasmids, which share large parts of their sequences. This makes it very likely that these plasmids are relatively stable and share common ancestors before the diversification of Borrelia species. The analysis of the differences between B. garinii PBi and B. afzelii PKo genomes of low and high passages revealed that the loss of infectivity is accompanied in both species by a loss of similar genetic material. Whereas B. garinii PBi suffered only from the break-off of a plasmid end, B. afzelii PKo lost more material, probably an entire plasmid. In both cases the vls gene locus encoding for variable surface proteins is affected.
CONCLUSIONS:
The complete genome sequences of a B. garinii and a B. afzelii strain facilitate further comparative studies within the genus Borrellia. Our study shows that loss of infectivity can be traced back to only one single event in B. garinii PBi: the loss of the vls cassettes possibly due to error prone gene conversion. Similar albeit extended losses in B. afzelii PKo support the hypothesis that infectivity of Borrelia species depends heavily on the evasion from the host response.

The standard treatment for ovarian cancer is chemotherapy with 2 drugs (taxanes and platinum drugs). However, the traditional combination of the 2 drugs has many adverse effects (AEs) and the cancer cells will quickly become resistant to the drugs. Apatinib is a small-molecule antiangiogenic agent which has shown promising therapeutic effects against diverse tumor types, but it still remains unknown whether apatinib has an antitumor effect in patients with ovarian cancer. Herein, we present a successfully treated case of ovarian cancer using chemotherapy and apatinib, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new combined regimen in ovarian cancer.
UNASSIGNED:
A 51-year-old Chinese woman presented with ovarian cancer >4.5 years. The disease and the cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) had been controlled well by surgical treatment and following chemotherapy. However, the drugs could not control the disease anymore as the CA-125 level was significantly increasing.
METHODS:
Ovarian cancer.
METHODS:
The patient was treated with apatinib combined with epirubicin. Apatinib was administered orally, at an initial daily dose of 500 mg, and was then reduced to 250 mg qd after the appearance of intolerable hand-foot syndrome (HFS) and oral ulcer. Then, the oral ulcer disappeared and the HFS was controlled by dose adjustment, oral vitamin B6, and hand cream application.
RESULTS:
The CA-125 reverted to the normal value after treatment with the new regimen. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the original tumor lesions had disappeared. Apatinib monotherapy as maintenance therapy was then used to successfully control the cancer with a complete response. Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to report the therapeutic effects of apatinib and epirubicin on ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSIONS:
Apatinib combined with chemotherapy and apatinib monotherapy as maintenance therapy could be a new therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancer, especially adenocarcinomas.

Using an integrated approach combining mutation profile and insertion/deletion analyses, we identified nine novel lineage-specific Alu subfamilies in lemur (seven), marmoset (one), and baboon/macaque (one) containing multiple diagnostic mutations distinct from their human counterparts-Alu J, S, and Y subfamilies, respectively. Among these primates, we show that that the lemur has the lowest density of Alu repeats (55 repeats/Mb), while marmoset has the greatest abundance (188 repeats/Mb). We estimate that approximately 70% of lemur and 16% of marmoset Alu elements belong to lineage-specific subfamilies. Our analysis has provided an evolutionary framework for further classification and refinement of the Alu repeat phylogeny. The differences in the distribution and rates of Alu activity have played an important role in subtly reshaping the structure of primate genomes. The functional consequences of these changes among the diverse primate lineages over such short periods of evolutionary time are an important area of future investigation.",1,0,1,0,0

However, under more diverse everyday conditions, such programmes tend not to show such positive effects. This study examined the process of implementing a classroom-based CBT depression prevention programme as part of a large (n = 5,030) randomised controlled trial across eight UK secondary schools which was not found to be effective (PROMISE, ISRCTN19083628). The views of young people (n = 42), teachers (n = 12) and facilitators (n = 16) involved in the Resourceful Adolescent Programme (RAP) were obtained via focus groups and interviews which were thematically analysed. The programme was considered to be well structured and contain useful content, particularly for younger pupils. However, challenges associated with implementation were its age appropriateness for all year groups, its perceived lack of flexibility, the consistency of quality of delivery, the competing demands for teacher time and a culture where academic targets were prioritised over personal, social and health education. Whilst schools are convenient locations for introducing such programmes and allow good reach, the culture around improving well-being of young people in schools, increasing engagement with teachers and young people and sustaining such programmes are issues that need addressing.

27332964,2016,"OVATE gene was first identified as a key regulator of fruit shape in tomato. OVATE family proteins (OFPs) are characterized as plant-specific transcription factors and conserved in Arabidopsis, tomato, and rice. Roles of OFPs involved in plant development and growth are largely unknown. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid hormones involved in diverse biological functions. OsGKS2 plays a critical role in BR signaling by phosphorylating downstream components such as OsBZR1 and DLT. Here we report in rice that OsOFP8 plays a positive role in BR signaling pathway. BL treatment induced the expression of OsOFP8 and led to enhanced accumulation of OsOFP8 protein. The gain-of-function mutant Osofp8 and OsOFP8 overexpression lines showed enhanced lamina joint inclination, whereas OsOFP8 RNAi transgenic lines showed more upright leaf phenotype, which suggest that OsOFP8 is involved in BR responses. Further analyses indicated that OsGSK2 interacts with and phosphorylates OsOFP8. BRZ treatment resulted in the cytoplasmic distribution of OsOFP8, and bikinin treatment reduced the cytoplasmic accumulation of OsOFP8. Phosphorylation of OsOFP8 by OsGSK2 is needed for its nuclear export. The phospphorylated OsOFP8 shuttles to the cytoplasm and is targeted for proteasomal degradation. These results indicate that OsOFP8 is a substrate of OsGSK2 and the function of OsOFP8 in plant growth and development is at least partly through the BR signaling pathway.",1,0,1,0,0
31366932,2019,"Intrinsically stretchable conductors have undergone rapid development in the past few years and a variety of strategies have been established to improve their electro-mechanical properties. However, ranging from electronically to ionically conductive materials, they are usually vulnerable either to large deformation or at high/low temperatures, mainly due to the fact that conductive domains are generally incompatible with neighboring elastic networks. This is a problem that is usually overlooked and remains challenging to address. Here, we introduce synergistic effect between conductive zwitterionic nanochannels and dynamic hydrogen-bonding networks to break the limitations. The conductor is highly transparent (>90% transmittance), ultra-stretchable (>10,000% strain), high-modulus (>2 MPa Young's modulus), self-healing, and capable of maintaining stable conductivity during large deformation and at different temperatures.

11185579,2000,"OBJECTIVE:
To review genetic variants of Cockayne syndrome (CS) and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), autosomal recessive disorders of DNA repair that affect the nervous system, and to illustrate them by the first case of xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS) complex to undergo neuropathologic examination.
METHODS:
Published reports of clinical, pathologic, and molecular studies of CS, XP neurologic disease, and the XP-CS complex were reviewed, and a ninth case of XP-CS is summarized.
RESULTS:
CS is a multisystem disorder that causes both profound growth failure of the soma and brain and progressive cachexia, retinal, cochlear, and neurologic degeneration, with a leukodystrophy and demyelinating neuropathy without an increase in cancer. XP presents as extreme photosensitivity of the skin and eyes with a 1000-fold increased frequency of cutaneous basal and squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas and a small increase in nervous system neoplasms. Some 20% of patients with XP incur progressive degeneration of previously normally developed neurons resulting in cortical, basal ganglia, cerebellar, and spinal atrophy, cochlear degeneration, and a mixed distal axonal neuropathy. Cultured cells from patients with CS or XP are hypersensitive to killing by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Both CS and most XP cells have defective DNA nucleotide excision repair of actively transcribing genes; in addition, XP cells have defective repair of the global genome. There are two complementation groups in CS and seven in XP. Patients with the XP-CS complex fall into three XP complementation groups. Despite their XP genotype, six of nine individuals with the XP-CS complex, including the boy we followed up to his death at age 6, had the typical clinically and pathologically severe CS phenotype. Cultured skin and blood cells had extreme sensitivity to killing by UV radiation, DNA repair was severely deficient, post-UV unscheduled DNA synthesis was reduced to less than 5%, and post-UV plasmid mutation frequency was increased.
CONCLUSIONS:
The paradoxical lack of parallelism of phenotype to genotype is unexplained in these disorders. Perhaps diverse mutations responsible for UV sensitivity and deficient DNA repair may also produce profound failure of brain and somatic growth, progressive cachexia and premature aging, and tissue-selective neurologic deterioration by their roles in regulation of transcription and repair of endogenous oxidative DNA damage.

33030866,2020,"OBJECTIVE:
To evaluate the result of an inpatient postpartum human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization pilot program in a diverse, low-income patient population from an urban, hospital-based obstetrics and gynecology clinic.
METHODS:
In this cohort study, we present results from the first 2 years of the inpatient postpartum HPV immunization program, in which vaccine-eligible postpartum women were identified and immunized during their hospital stays. The program was implemented after educational outreach with prenatal and postpartum clinicians and nurses. Associations between receipt of the HPV vaccine as an inpatient and the characteristics of patients, and the likelihood of and missed opportunities for receiving a subsequent dose of the HPV vaccine as an outpatient were determined using logistic regression, time-to-event analyses, chi-squared tests and t-tests.
RESULTS:
From April 11, 2017, to April 10, 2019, 394 (59.2%) of 666 postpartum women were eligible for the inpatient postpartum HPV immunization program. The majority (265/394, 67.3%) received the immunization pilot program HPV dose; 36 of those 265 (13.6%) completed the series with that dose. Among women due for additional doses after hospital discharge, those who received the inpatient dose were more likely to receive a subsequent outpatient dose (138/229) than were those who did not receive an inpatient dose (39/129; hazard ratio 2.51, 95% CI 1.76-3.58). On average, there were 30.7 fewer (95% CI 5.8-55.6, P<.02) missed opportunities for subsequent outpatient doses for every 100 eligible visits among women who received the inpatient dose, compared with women who did not. By the end of the study, the proportion of women who had completed the vaccine series was higher among women who received the inpatient dose (95/265, 35.8%) than in those who did not (12 out 129, 9.3%; odds ratio 5.45, 95% CI 2.86-10.38).
CONCLUSION:
The inpatient postpartum HPV immunization program was associated with increased rates of immunization and addressed a previously missed opportunity. Inpatient immunization programs can serve as a critical way to address gaps in vaccine uptake.

23342041,2013,"BACKGROUND:
Little is known about the population biology of Streptococcus pneumoniae in developing countries, although the majority of pneumococcal infections occur in this setting. The aim of the study was to apply MLST to investigate the population biology of S. pneumoniae in West Africa.
METHODS:
Seventy three invasive and carriage S. pneumoniae isolates from three West African countries including The Gambia, Nigeria and Ghana were investigated. The isolates covered seven serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 11, 14, 23F) and were subjected to multilocus sequence typing and antibiotic susceptibility testing.
RESULTS:
Overall, 50 different sequence types (STs) were identified, of which 38% (29) were novel. The most common ST was a novel clone-ST 4012 (6.5%), and some clones including STs 913, 925, 1737, 2160 and 3310 appeared to be specific to the study region. Two STs including ST 63 and ST 4012 were associated with multiple serotypes indicating a history of serotype switching. ST 63 was associated with serotypes 3 and 23F, while ST 4012 was associated with serotypes 6A and 23. eBURST analyses using the stringent 6/7 identical loci definition grouped the 50 STs into 5 clonal complexes and 65 singletons, expressing a high level of genetic diversity among the isolates. Compared to the other serotypes, serotypes 1 and 5 isolates appeared to be more clonal. Internationally recognized antibiotic resistant clones of S. pneumoniae were generally absent in the population investigated and the only multidrug resistant isolate identified (1/66) belong to the Pneumocococcal Epidemiology Network clone ST 63.
CONCLUSIONS:
The pneumococcal population in West Africa is quite divergent, and serotypes that are common in invasive disease (such as serotypes 1 and 5) are more likely to be clonal than serotypes that are common in carriage.

14761657,2004,"The rhomboids are a recently discovered family of intramembrane proteases that are conserved across evolution. Drosophila was the first organism in which they were characterized, where at least Rhomboids 1-3 activate EGF receptor signaling by releasing the active forms of EGF-like growth factors. Subsequent work has begun to shed light on the role of these proteases in bacteria and yeast, but nothing is known about the function of rhomboids in vertebrates beyond evidence that the subclass of mitochondrial rhomboids is conserved. Here, we report that the anticoagulant cell-surface protein thrombomodulin is the first mammalian protein to be a rhomboid substrate in a cell culture assay. The thrombomodulin transmembrane domain (TMD) is cleaved only by vertebrate RHBDL2-like rhomboids. Thrombomodulin TMD cleavage is directed not by sequences within the TMD, as is the case with Spitz but by its cytoplasmic domain, which, at least in some contexts, is necessary and sufficient to determine cleavage by RHBDL2. These data suggest that thrombomodulin could be a physiological substrate for rhomboid. Moreover, the discovery of a second mode of substrate recognition by rhomboids implies mechanistic diversity in this family of intramembrane proteases.",1,0,1,0,0
26268218,2015,"BACKGROUND:
Soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is one of the most fatal pests of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) worldwide and causes huge loss of soybean yield each year. Multiple sources of resistance are urgently needed for effective management of SCN via the development of resistant cultivars. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic architecture of resistance to SCN HG Type 0 (race 3) and HG Type 1.2.3.5.7 (race 4) in landraces and released elite soybean cultivars mostly from China.
RESULTS:
A total of 440 diverse soybean landraces and elite cultivars were screened for resistance to SCN HG Type 0 and HG Type 1.2.3.5.7. Exactly 131 new sources of SCN resistance were identified. Lines were genotyped by SNP markers detected by the Specific Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing (SLAF-seq) approach. A total of 36,976 SNPs were identified with minor allele frequencies (MAF) > 4% that were present in 97% of all the genotypes. Genome-wide association mapping showed that a total of 19 association signals were significantly related to the resistance for the two HG Types. Of the 19 association signals, eight signals overlapped with reported QTL including Rhg1 and Rhg4 genes. Another eight were located in the linked regions encompassing known QTL. Three QTL were found that were not previously reported. The average value of female index (FI) of soybean accessions with resistant alleles was significantly lower than those with susceptible alleles for each peak SNP. Disease resistance proteins with leucine rich regions, cytochrome P450s, protein kinases, zinc finger domain proteins, RING domain proteins, MYB and WRKY transcription activation families were identified. Such proteins may participate in the resistant reaction to SCN and were frequently found in the tightly linked genomic regions of the peak SNPs.
CONCLUSIONS:
GWAS extended understanding of the genetic architecture of SCN resistance in multiple genetic backgrounds. Nineteen association signals were obtained for the resistance to the two Hg Types of SCN. The multiple beneficial alleles from resistant germplasm sources will be useful for the breeding of cultivars with improved resistance to SCN. Analysis of genes near association signals may facilitate the recognition of the causal gene(s) underlying SCN resistances.

18186703,2008,"The induction of hypometabolism in cells and organs to reduce ischemia damage holds enormous clinical promise in diverse fields, including treatment of stroke and heart attack. However, the thought that humans can undergo a severe hypometabolic state analogous to hibernation borders on science fiction. Some mammals can enter a severe hypothermic state during hibernation in which metabolic activity is extremely low, and yet full viability is restored when the animal arouses from such a state. To date, the underlying mechanism for hibernation or similar behaviors remains an enigma. The beneficial effect of hypothermia, which reduces cellular metabolic demands, has many well-established clinical applications. However, severe hypothermia induced by clinical drugs is extremely difficult and is associated with dramatically increased rates of cardiac arrest for nonhibernators. The recent discovery of a biomolecule, 5'-AMP, which allows nonhibernating mammals to rapidly and safely enter severe hypothermia could remove this impediment and enable the wide adoption of hypothermia as a routine clinical tool.",1,0,1,0,0

To better understand promotion timelines across gender and race/ethnicity and how academic output impacts promotion in urology.
METHODS:
We examined the 2017 census. An academic subset was asked questions regarding their promotion timeline. We obtained demographic, academic output, and family responsibility data.
RESULTS:
Of 2926 academic urologists who identified a position of Assistant, Associate, or Full professor, 11.2% were women, 75% were White, and 94% were non-Hispanic. Men authored more papers and achieved principal investigator status more often than women. Non-Hispanics authored more papers than Hispanics. On average, women took 1.2 years longer than men to advance from Assistant to Associate Professor (7.3 years [95% CI: 6.8-7.8] vs 6.1 years, [95% CI: 5.8-6.6, P <.001]). Advancement from Associate to Full Professor was similar between women and men (6.0 years [95% CI: 5.1-6.9] vs 6.6 [95% CI: 6.1-7.1, P = .25]). Compared to women, men were more likely to experience rapid promotion (≤4 years) to Associate Professor (odds ratio 3 [95% CI: 1.8-5.1]). There was no statistical difference across race/ethnicity for promotion from Assistant to Associate, Associate to Full Professor, or rapid promotion.
CONCLUSIONS:
We identified disparities in promotion times based on gender but not race and ethnicity. The number of under-represented minority faculty in urology is low. Understanding the causes of disparities should be a priority in order to support fair promotion practices and retention of diverse faculty.

26758525,2016,"Transient resistance can allow microorganisms to temporarily survive lethal concentrations of antibiotics. This can be accomplished through stochastic mechanisms, where individual cells within a population display diverse phenotypes to hedge against the appearance of an antibiotic. To date, research on transient stochastic resistance has focused primarily on mechanisms where a subpopulation of cells enters a dormant, drug-tolerant state. However, a fundamental question is whether stochastic gene expression can also generate variable resistance levels among growing cells in a population. We hypothesized that stochastic expression of antibiotic-inducible resistance mechanisms might play such a role. To investigate this, we focused on a prototypical example of such a system: the multiple antibiotic resistance activator MarA. Previous studies have shown that induction of MarA can lead to a multidrug resistant phenotype at the population level. We asked whether MarA expression also has a stochastic component, even when uninduced. Time lapse microscopy showed that isogenic cells express heterogeneous, dynamic levels of MarA, which were correlated with transient antibiotic survival. This finding has important clinical implications, as stochastic expression of resistance genes may be widespread, allowing populations to hedge against the sudden appearance of an antibiotic.

26867131,2016,"We investigated the diversity and distribution of fungi in nine different sites inside 30 residential dishwashers. In total, 503 fungal strains were isolated, which belong to 10 genera and 84 species. Irrespective of the sampled site, 83% of the dishwashers were positive for fungi. The most frequent opportunistic pathogenic species were Exophiala dermatitidis, Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto, Exophiala phaeomuriformis, Fusarium dimerum, and the Saprochaete/Magnusiomyces clade. The black yeast E. dermatitidis was detected in 47% of the dishwashers, primarily at the dishwasher rubber seals, at up to 106 CFU/cm2; the other fungi detected were in the range of 102 to 105 CFU/cm2. The other most heavily contaminated dishwasher sites were side nozzles, doors and drains. Only F. dimerum was isolated from washed dishes, while dishwasher waste water contained E. dermatitidis, Exophiala oligosperma and Sarocladium killiense. Plumbing systems supplying water to household appliances represent the most probable route for contamination of dishwashers, as the fungi that represented the core dishwasher mycobiota were also detected in the tap water. Hot aerosols from dishwashers contained the human opportunistic yeast C. parapsilosis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and E. dermatitidis (as well as common air-borne genera such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma and Cladosporium). Comparison of fungal contamination of kitchens without and with dishwashers revealed that virtually all were contaminated with fungi. In both cases, the most contaminated sites were the kitchen drain and the dish drying rack. The most important difference was higher prevalence of black yeasts (E. dermatitidis in particular) in kitchens with dishwashers. In kitchens without dishwashers, C. parapsilosis strongly prevailed with negligible occurrence of E. dermatitidis. F. dimerum was isolated only from kitchens with dishwashers, while Saprochaete/Magnusiomyces isolates were only found within dishwashers. We conclude that dishwashers represent a reservoir of enriched opportunistic pathogenic species that can spread from the dishwasher into the indoor biome. ",1,0,1,2,2
24146780,2013,"Human presence and activity in tropical forest is thought to exert top-down regulation over the various 'green-world' pathways of plant-based foodwebs. However, these effects have never been explored for the 'brown-world' pathways of fecal-detritus webs. The strong effects of humans on tropical game mammals are likely to indirectly influence fecal detritivores (including Scarabaeine dung beetles), with subsequent indirect impacts on detrivore-mediated and plant-facilitating detrital processes. Across a 380-km gradient of human influence in the western Brazilian Amazon, we conducted the first landscape-level assessment of human-induced cascade effects on the fecal detritus pathway, by coupling data on human impact, game mammal and detritivore community structure, and rate measurements of a key detritus process (i.e. dung beetle-mediated secondary seed dispersal). We found evidence that human impact indirectly influences both the diversity and biomass of fecal detritivores, but not detritivore-mediated processes. Cascade strength varied across detritivore groups defined by species' traits. We found smaller-bodied dung beetles were at higher risk of local decline in areas of human presence, and that body size was a better predictor of cascade structure than fecal resource manipulation strategy. Cascade strength was also stronger in upland, unflooded forests, than in seasonally flooded forests. Our results suggest that the impact of human activity in tropical forest on fecal-detritus food web structure is mediated by both species' traits and habitat type. Further research will be required to determine the conditions under which these cascade effects influence fecal-detritus web function. ",1,0,1,0,3
20607764,2011,"Until now, the general importance of microvilli present on the surface of almost all differentiated cells has been strongly underestimated and essential functions of these abundant surface organelles remained unrecognized. Commonly, the role of microvilli has been reduced to their putative function of cell-surface enlargement. In spite of a large body of detailed knowledge about the specific functions of microvilli in sensory receptor cells for sound, light, and odor perception, their functional importance for regulation of basic cell functions remained obscure. Here, a number of microvillar mechanisms involved in fundamental cell functions are discussed. Two structural features enable the extensive functional competence of microvilli: First, the exclusive location of almost all functional important membrane proteins on microvilli of differentiated cells and second, the function of the F-actin-based cytoskeletal core of microvilli as a structural diffusion barrier modulating the flow of low molecular substrates and ions into and out of the cell. The specific localization on microvilli of important functional membrane proteins such as glucose transporters, ion channels, ion pumps, and ion exchangers indicate the importance and diversity of microvillar functions. In this review, the microvillar mechanisms of audioreceptor, photoreceptor, and olfactory/taste receptor cells are discussed as highly specialized adaptations of a general type of microvillar mechanisms involved in regulation of important basic cell functions such as glucose transport/energy metabolism, ion channel regulation, generation and modulation of the membrane potential, volume regulation, and Ca signaling. Even the constitutive cellular defence against cytotoxic compounds, also called ""multidrug resistance (MDR),"" is discussed as a microvillar mechanism. A comprehensive examination of the specific properties of ""cable-like"" ion conduction along the microvillar core structure of F-actin allows the proposal that microvilli are specifically designed for using ionic currents as cellular signals. In view of the multifaceted gating and signaling properties of TRP channels, the possible role of microvilli as a universal gating device for TRP channel regulation is discussed. Combined with the role of the microvillar core bundle of actin filaments as high-affinity Ca store, microvilli may turn out as highly specialized Ca signaling organelle involved in store-operated Ca entry (SOCE) and initiation of nonlinear Ca signals such as waves and oscillations.",1,0,1,0,0
31870287,2019,"BACKGROUND:
Little is known why proteins and RNAs exhibit half-lives varying over several magnitudes. Despite many efforts, a conclusive link between half-lives and gene function could not be established suggesting that other determinants may influence these molecular attributes.
RESULTS:
Here, I find that with increasing gene age there is a gradual and significant increase of protein and RNA half-lives, protein structure, and other molecular attributes that tend to affect protein abundance. These observations are accommodated in a hypothesis which posits that new genes at 'birth' are not optimized and thus their products exhibit low half-lives and less structure but continuous mutagenesis eventually improves these attributes. Thus, the protein and RNA products of the oldest genes obtained their high degrees of stability and structure only after billions of years while the products of younger genes had less time to be optimized and are therefore less stable and structured. Because more stable proteins with lower turnover require less transcription to maintain the same level of abundance, reduced transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) would fixate the changes by increasing gene conservation.
CONCLUSIONS:
Consequently, the currently observed diversity of molecular attributes is a snapshot of gene products being at different stages along their temporal path of optimization.

Tobacco use among young people is a complex and serious global dilemma that demands innovative and diverse research approaches. The purpose of this methodological review was to examine the current use of mixed methods research in tobacco control with youth and young adult populations and to develop practical recommendations for tobacco control researchers interested in this methodology.
METHODS:
Using PubMed, we searched five peer-reviewed journals that publish tobacco control empirical literature for the use of mixed methods research to study young populations, age 12-25 years. Our team analyzed the features of each article in terms of tobacco control topic, population, youth engagement strategies, and several essential elements of mixed methods research.
RESULTS:
We identified 23 mixed methods studies published by authors from five different countries reported between 2004 and 2015. These 23 articles examined various topics that included tobacco use behavior, tobacco marketing and branding, and cessation among youth and young adults. The most common mixed methods approach was variations of the concurrent design in which the qualitative and quantitative strands were administered at the same time and given equal priority. This review documented several innovative applications of mixed methods research as well as challenges in the reporting of the complex research designs.

33272129,2020,"OBJECTIVE:
A survival advantage among individuals with higher body mass index (BMI) has been observed for diverse acute illnesses, including stroke, and termed the obesity paradox. However, prior ischemic stroke studies have generally tested only for linear rather than nonlinear relations between body mass and outcome, and few studies have investigated poststroke functional outcomes in addition to mortality.
METHODS:
We analyzed consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke enrolled in a 60-center acute treatment trial, the NIH FAST-MAG acute stroke trial. Outcomes at 3 months analyzed were (1) death; (2) disability or death (modified Rankin Scale score, 2-6); and (3) low stroke-related quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale<median). Relations with BMI were analyzed univariately and in multivariate models adjusting for 14 additional prognostic variables.
RESULTS:
Among 1033 patients with acute ischemic stroke, average age was 71 years (±13), 45.1% female, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 10.6 (±8.3), and BMI 27.5 (±5.6). In both unadjusted and adjusted analysis, increasing BMI was linearly associated with improved 3-month survival (

Mortality and functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke have disparate relations with patients' adiposity. Higher BMI is linearly associated with increased survival; and BMI has a U-shaped or J-shaped relation to disability and stroke-related quality of life.

This is true whether the functional unit was mass, energy, or protein content, and whether the environmental impact was measured as global warming potential or the monetized value of 16 impact categories. We conclude that large-scale public procurement of snack-meals by private and municipal kitchens can be reduced by up to 40% if the kitchens evaluate the environmental impact of all their snacks and serve the better half more frequently.",1,1,3,0,1
33071911,2020,"According to the research on the influence of resources on mate selection, the amount of financial resources affects an individual's choice of ""luxuries"" and ""necessities"" among mate selection cues, while the amount of time resources affects cue diversity. However, for a long time, researchers only paid attention to the impact of financial resources and ignored the role of time resources. Therefore, this paper draws lessons from the relevant research on the influence of time on decision-making and proposes to study mate selection from the perspective of decision-making. Additionally, current research concerning the influence of resources on the choice of a spouse focuses more on results and neglects to examine the process. Therefore, based on the relevant theories, this paper makes several theoretical assumptions regarding the influence mechanism of resource availability on mate choice decisions, gender differences, and the actor-partner effect.",1,1,2,0,0
16769388,2006,"OBJECTIVE:
To compare and contrast proposed definitions of metabolic syndrome in pediatrics, and to determine prevalence of metabolic syndrome in preadolescent females when applying different criteria.
METHODS:
A literature review on definitions of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular ""risk factor clustering"" in children and adolescents published in the past decade. Pediatric definitions of metabolic syndrome were then applied to a community-based study of 261 black preadolescent females (Girls Health Enrichment MultiSite studies [GEMS]) and a school-based, cross-sectional study of 240 ethnically-diverse preadolescent females (Girls Activity, Movement and Environmental Strategy [GAMES]) who had a baseline physical examination and fasting morning blood sample.
RESULTS:
Agreement among pediatric definitions of metabolic syndrome was poor. The prevalence of MS and cardiovascular risk factor clustering ranged from 0.4% to 23.0% for GEMS and 2.0% to 24.6% for GAMES with definitions adapted from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III, and 0% to 15.3% for GEMS and 0.4% to 15.8% for GAMES using modified criteria from the World Health Organization.
CONCLUSIONS:
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in preadolescent girls varies widely because of disagreement among proposed definitions of metabolic syndrome in pediatrics. Further investigation is needed to determine which metabolic factors and their respective cut points should be used to identify children at risk for development of clinical disease.

31345636,2019,"BACKGROUND:
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA; folate hydrolase) prostate cancer (PC) expression has theranostic utility.
OBJECTIVE:
To elucidate PC PSMA expression and associate this with defective DNA damage repair (DDR).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
Membranous PSMA (mPSMA) expression was scored immunohistochemically from metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) and matching, same-patient, diagnostic biopsies, and correlated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and clinical outcome data.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
Expression of mPSMA was quantitated by modified H-score. Patient DNA was tested by NGS. Gene expression and activity scores were determined from mCRPC transcriptomes. Statistical correlations utilised Wilcoxon signed rank tests, survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier test, and sample heterogeneity was quantified by Shannon's diversity index.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS:
Expression of mPSMA at diagnosis was associated with higher Gleason grade (p=0.04) and worse overall survival (p=0.006). Overall, mPSMA expression levels increased at mCRPC (median H-score [interquartile range]: castration-sensitive prostate cancer [CSPC] 17.5 [0.0-60.0] vs mCRPC 55.0 [2.8-117.5]). Surprisingly, 42% (n=16) of CSPC and 27% (n=16) of mCRPC tissues sampled had no detectable mPSMA (H-score <10). Marked intratumour heterogeneity of mPSMA expression, with foci containing no detectable PSMA, was observed in all mPSMA expressing CSPC (100%) and 37 (84%) mCRPC biopsies. Heterogeneous intrapatient mPSMA expression between metastases was also observed, with the lowest expression in liver metastases. Tumours with DDR had higher mPSMA expression (p=0.016; 87.5 [25.0-247.5] vs 20 [0.3-98.8]; difference in medians 60 [5.0-95.0]); validation cohort studies confirmed higher mPSMA expression in patients with deleterious aberrations in BRCA2 (p<0.001; median H-score: 300 [165-300]; difference in medians 195.0 [100.0-270.0]) and ATM (p=0.005; 212.5 [136.3-300]; difference in medians 140.0 [55.0-200]) than in molecularly unselected mCRPC biopsies (55.0 [2.75-117.5]). Validation studies using mCRPC transcriptomes corroborated these findings, also indicating that SOX2 high tumours have low PSMA expression.
CONCLUSIONS:
Membranous PSMA expression is upregulated in some but not all PCs, with mPSMA expression demonstrating marked inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity. DDR aberrations are associated with higher mPSMA expression and merit further evaluation as predictive biomarkers of response for PSMA-targeted therapies in larger, prospective cohorts.
PATIENT SUMMARY:
Through analysis of prostate cancer samples, we report that the presence of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is extremely variable both within one patient and between different patients. This may limit the usefulness of PSMA scans and PSMA-targeted therapies. We show for the first time that prostate cancers with defective DNA repair produce more PSMA and so may respond better to PSMA-targeting treatments.

9743525,1998,"The movement of leukocytes into tissues is regulated by the local production of chemical mediators collectively referred to as chemoattractants. Although chemoattractants constitute a diverse array of molecules, including proteins, peptides, and lipids, they all appear to signal leukocytes through a related family of seven transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors. The eosinophil is a potent proinflammatory cell that is attracted into tissues during allergic inflammation, parasitic infection, and certain malignancies. Since the molecular mechanisms controlling eosinophil recruitment are incompletely understood, we performed a degenerate polymerase chain reaction on cDNA isolated from murine eosinophils to identify novel chemoattractant receptors. We report the isolation of a cDNA that encodes a 351-amino acid glycoprotein that is 78% identical to a human gene that has been reported to be a purinoceptor (P2Y7) and a leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor (BLTR). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with this cDNA specifically bound [3H]LTB4 with a dissociation constant of 0.6 +/- 0.1 nM. Furthermore, LTB4 induced a dose-dependent intracellular calcium flux in transfected CHO cells. In contrast, [35S]dATP did not specifically bind to these transfectants. This mRNA was expressed at high levels in interleukin 5-exposed eosinophils, elicited peritoneal macrophages and neutrophils, and to a lesser extent interferon gamma stimulated macrophages. Low levels of expression were detected in the lung, lymph node, and spleen of unchallenged mice. Western blot analysis detected the mBLTR protein in murine eosinophils and alveolar macrophages as well as human eosinophils. In addition, elevated levels of mBLTR mRNA were found in the lungs of mice in a murine model of allergic pulmonary inflammation in a time course consistent with the influx of eosinophils. Our findings indicate that this murine receptor is an LTB4 receptor that is highly expressed on activated leukocytes, including eosinophils, and may play an important role in mediating eosinophil recruitment into inflammatory foci.",1,0,1,0,2
31983341,2020,"Managing and adapting to climate change in urban areas will become increasingly important as urban populations grow, especially because unique features of cities amplify climate change impacts. High impervious cover exacerbates impacts of climate warming through urban heat island effects and of heavy rainfall by magnifying runoff and flooding. Concentration of human settlements along rivers and coastal zones increases exposure of people and infrastructure to climate change hazards, often disproportionately affecting those who are least prepared. Nature-based strategies (NBS), which use living organisms, soils and sediments, and/or landscape features to reduce climate change hazards, hold promise as being more flexible, multi-functional and adaptable to an uncertain and non-stationary climate future than traditional approaches. Nevertheless, future research should address the effectiveness of NBS for reducing climate change impacts and whether they can be implemented at scales appropriate to climate change hazards and impacts. Further, there is a need for accurate and comprehensive cost-benefit analyses that consider disservices and co-benefits, relative to grey alternatives, and how costs and benefits are distributed across different communities. NBS are most likely to be effective and fair when they match the scale of the challenge, are implemented with input from diverse voices and are appropriate to specific social, cultural, ecological and technological contexts.

22881460,2012,"Epithelial tissue formation and function requires the apical-basal polarization of individual epithelial cells. Apical polarity regulators (APRs) are an evolutionarily conserved group of key factors that govern polarity and several other aspects of epithelial differentiation. APRs compose a diverse set of molecules including a transmembrane protein (Crumbs), a serine/threonine kinase (aPKC), a lipid phosphatase (PTEN), a small GTPase (Cdc42), FERM domain proteins (Moesin, Yurt), and several adaptor or scaffolding proteins (Bazooka/Par3, Par6, Stardust, Patj). These proteins form a dynamic cooperative network that is engaged in negative-feedback regulation with basolateral polarity factors to set up the epithelial apical-basal axis. APRs support the formation of the apical junctional complex and the segregation of the junctional domain from the apical membrane. It is becoming increasingly clear that APRs interact with the cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking machinery, regulate morphogenesis, and modulate epithelial cell growth and survival. Not surprisingly, APRs have multiple fundamental links to human diseases such as cancer and blindness.",1,1,2,0,0
28731407,2017,"Diversity of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, generated by somatic DNA rearrangements, is central to immune system function. However, the level of sequence similarity of TCR repertoires within and between species has not been characterized. Using network analysis of high-throughput TCR sequencing data, we found that abundant CDR3-TCRβ sequences were clustered within networks generated by sequence similarity. We discovered a substantial number of public CDR3-TCRβ segments that were identical in mice and humans. These conserved public sequences were central within TCR sequence-similarity networks. Annotated TCR sequences, previously associated with self-specificities such as autoimmunity and cancer, were linked to network clusters. Mechanistically, CDR3 networks were promoted by MHC-mediated selection, and were reduced following immunization, immune checkpoint blockade or aging. Our findings provide a new view of T cell repertoire organization and physiology, and suggest that the immune system distributes its TCR sequences unevenly, attending to specific foci of reactivity.",1,1,2,0,0
27986804,2016,"The dwarf phenotype characterizes the smallest of rabbit breeds and is governed largely by the effects of a single dwarfing allele with an incompletely dominant effect on growth. Dwarf rabbits typically weigh under 1 kg and have altered craniofacial morphology. The dwarf allele is recessive lethal and dwarf homozygotes die within a few days of birth. The dwarf phenotype is expressed in heterozygous individuals and rabbits from dwarf breeds homozygous for the wild-type allele are normal, although smaller when compared to other breeds. Here, we show that the dwarf allele constitutes a ∼12.1 kb deletion overlapping the promoter region and first three exons of the HMGA2 gene leading to inactivation of this gene. HMGA2 has been frequently associated with variation in body size across species. Homozygotes for null alleles are viable in mice but not in rabbits and probably not in humans. RNA-sequencing analysis of rabbit embryos showed that very few genes (4-29 genes) were differentially expressed among the three HMGA2/dwarf genotypes, suggesting that dwarfism and inviability in rabbits are caused by modest changes in gene expression. Our results show that HMGA2 is critical for normal expression of IGF2BP2, which encodes an RNA-binding protein. Finally, we report a catalog of regions of elevated genetic differentiation between dwarf and normal-size rabbits, including LCORL-NCAPG, STC2, HOXD cluster, and IGF2BP2 Levels and patterns of genetic diversity at the LCORL-NCAPG locus further suggest that small size in dwarf breeds was enhanced by crosses with wild rabbits. Overall, our results imply that small size in dwarf rabbits results from a large effect, loss-of-function (LOF) mutation in HMGA2 combined with polygenic selection.",1,1,13,0,0
25825775,2015,"Peptide-based agents derived from well-defined scaffolds offer an alternative to antibodies for selective and high-affinity recognition of large and topologically complex protein surfaces. Here, we describe a strategy for designing oligomers containing both α- and β-amino acid residues (""α/β-peptides"") that mimic several peptides derived from the three-helix bundle ""Z-domain"" scaffold. We show that α/β-peptides derived from a Z-domain peptide targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can structurally and functionally mimic the binding surface of the parent peptide while exhibiting significantly decreased susceptibility to proteolysis. The tightest VEGF-binding α/β-peptide inhibits the VEGF165-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We demonstrate the versatility of this strategy by showing how principles underlying VEGF signaling inhibitors can be rapidly extended to produce Z-domain-mimetic α/β-peptides that bind to two other protein partners, IgG and tumor necrosis factor-α. Because well-established selection techniques can identify high-affinity Z-domain derivatives from large DNA-encoded libraries, our findings should enable the design of biostable α/β-peptides that bind tightly and specifically to diverse targets of biomedical interest.

We have carried out the most extensive systematic cross-sectional study based on newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in 2013, and characterized the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequences in the whole of Hebei. Nine HIV-1 genotypes based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequence were identified among 610 newly diagnosed naïve individuals. The four main genotypes were circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE (53.4%), CRF07_BC (23.4%), subtype B (15.9%), and unique recombinant forms URFs (4.9%). Within 1 year, three new genotypes (subtype A1, CRF55_01B, CRF65_cpx), unknown before in Hebei, were first found among men who have sex with men (MSM). All nine genotypes were identified in the sexually contracted HIV-1 population.

This study elucidated the complicated characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in a low HIV-1 prevalence northern province of China and revealed the high level of HIV-1 genetic diversity.

22398447,2012,"The recognition of distinctly modified histones by specialized 'effector' proteins constitutes a key mechanism for transducing molecular events at chromatin to biological outcomes. Effector proteins influence DNA-templated processes, including transcription, DNA recombination and DNA repair; however, no effector functions have yet been identified within the mammalian machinery that regulate DNA replication. Here we show that ORC1--a component of ORC (origin of replication complex), which mediates pre-DNA replication licensing--contains a bromo adjacent homology (BAH) domain that specifically recognizes histone H4 dimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me2). Recognition of H4K20me2 is a property common to BAH domains present within diverse metazoan ORC1 proteins. Structural studies reveal that the specificity of the BAH domain for H4K20me2 is mediated by a dynamic aromatic dimethyl-lysine-binding cage and multiple intermolecular contacts involving the bound peptide. H4K20me2 is enriched at replication origins, and abrogating ORC1 recognition of H4K20me2 in cells impairs ORC1 occupancy at replication origins, ORC chromatin loading and cell-cycle progression. Mutation of the ORC1 BAH domain has been implicated in the aetiology of Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS), a form of primordial dwarfism, and ORC1 depletion in zebrafish results in an MGS-like phenotype. We find that wild-type human ORC1, but not ORC1-H4K20me2-binding mutants, rescues the growth retardation of orc1 morphants. Moreover, zebrafish depleted of H4K20me2 have diminished body size, mirroring the phenotype of orc1 morphants. Together, our results identify the BAH domain as a novel methyl-lysine-binding module, thereby establishing the first direct link between histone methylation and the metazoan DNA replication machinery, and defining a pivotal aetiological role for the canonical H4K20me2 mark, via ORC1, in primordial dwarfism.",1,1,3,0,0

The exploration of the ethnic origin and genetic structure within the Bahraini population is fundamental mainly in the field of population genetics and forensic science. The purpose of the study was to investigate and conduct genetic studies in the population of Bahrain to assist in the interpretation of DNA-based forensic evidence and in the construction of appropriate databases. 24 short-tandem repeats in the GlobalFiler PCR Amplification kit including 21 autosomal STR loci and three gender determination loci were amplified to characterize different genetic and forensic population parameters in a cohort of 543 Bahraini unrelated healthy men. Samples were collected during the year 2017. The genotyping of the 21 autosomal STRs showed all of the loci were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) after applying Bonferroni's correction. We also found out no significant deviations from LD between pairwise STR loci in Bahraini population except when plotting for D3S1358-CSF1PO, CSF1PO-SE33, D19S433-D12S391, FGA-D2S1338, FGA-SE33, FGA-D7S820 and D7S820-SE33. The SE33 locus was the most polymorphic for the studied population and THO1 locus was the less polymorphic. The Allele 8 in TPOX scored the highest allele frequency of 0.496. The SE33 locus showed the highest power of discrimination (PD) in Bahraini population, whereas TPOX showed the lowest PD value.

Off-ladders and tri-allelic variants were observed in various samples at D12S391, SE33 and D22S1045 loci. Additionally, pairwise genetic distances based on FST were calculated between Bahraini population and other populations extracted from the literature. Genetic distances were represented in a non-metric MDS plot and clustering of populations according to their geographic locations was detected. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to investigate the genetic relatedness between Bahraini population and the neighboring populations.

8373442,1993,"Enzymes within the CYP3A subfamily are major Phase I drug-metabolizing enzymes present in hepatocytes and small bowel enterocytes. These enzymes are highly inducible in the liver by many structurally diverse compounds, including a number of commonly used medications. Studies indicate that CYP3A enzymes present in small bowel enterocytes are also inducible. However, the regulation of CYP3A enzymes in this tissue has not been well characterized, in part because in vivo studies are difficult, especially in humans. Our goals was to develop an in vitro model to study the regulation of CYP3A in enterocytes. To this end, we defined culture conditions under which adult rat jejunal explants maintained viable appearing villi for 21 hr. When dexamethasone, the prototypical inducer of CYP3A1 in rat hepatocytes, was added to the culture medium, there was a time-dependent induction of CYP3A1 mRNA and CYP3A protein in explant enterocytes which was essentially indistinguishable from the time course of induction of CYP3A1 mRNA and protein in enterocytes in vivo. This effect of dexamethasone appeared to be specific since dexamethasone had no consistent effect on the explant concentration of another enterocyte specific mRNA, intestinal fatty acid binding protein. Using this explant culture model, we found that CYP3A1 mRNA was also inducible by clotrimazole but we were unable to detect induction by rifampicin or troleandomycin.

23593495,2013,"BACKGROUND:
Cultures of heterotrophic protists often require co-culturing with bacteria to act as a source of nutrition. Such cultures will contain varying levels of intrinsic bacterial contamination that can interfere with molecular research and cause problems with the collection of sufficient material for sequencing. Measuring the levels of bacterial contamination for the purposes of molecular biology research is non-trivial, and can be complicated by the presence of a diverse bacterial flora, or by differences in the relative nucleic acid yield per bacterial or eukaryotic cell.
RESULTS:
Here we describe a duplex PCR-based assay that can be used to measure the levels of contamination from marine bacteria in a culture of loricate choanoflagellates. By comparison to a standard culture of known target sequence content, the assay can be used to quantify the relative proportions of bacterial and choanoflagellate material in DNA or RNA samples extracted from a culture. We apply the assay to compare methods of purifying choanoflagellate cultures prior to DNA extraction, to determine their effectiveness in reducing bacterial contamination. Together with measurements of the total nucleic acid concentration, the assay can then be used as the basis for determining the absolute amounts of choanoflagellate DNA or RNA present in a sample.
CONCLUSIONS:
The assay protocol we describe here is a simple and relatively inexpensive method of measuring contamination levels in nucleic acid samples. This provides a new way to establish quantification and purification protocols for molecular biology and genomics in novel heterotrophic protist species. Guidelines are provided to develop a similar protocol for use with any protistan culture. This assay method is recommended where qPCR equipment is unavailable, where qPCR is not viable because of the nature of the bacterial contamination or starting material, or where prior sequence information is insufficient to develop qPCR protocols.

9673241,1998,"Phylogenetic analysis was utilized to investigate biological relationships (tissue tropism, disease presentation, and epidemiologic success), as evidenced by coevolution, among human strains of Chlamydia trachomatis. Nucleotide sequences of omp1, the gene encoding the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of C. trachomatis, were determined for 40 strains representing 11 serovars. These data were combined with available omp1 sequences from GenBank for an analysis encompassing a total of 69 strains representing 17 serovars infecting humans. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences showed no evolutionary relationships among serovars that corresponded to biological or pathological phenotypes (tissue tropism, disease presentation, and epidemiologic success). In addition, no specific residues that may have evolved to play a role in determining biologically relevant characteristics of chlamydia, such as tissue specificity, disease presentation, and epidemiologic success, were apparent in the MOMP. These results suggest that variation in MOMP may have arisen from a need to be diverse in the presence of immune pressure rather than as a function of pathogenicity. Therefore, the role of MOMP in disease pathogenesis and infection may be passive, and it may not be the major ligand responsible for directing infection of various human cell types.",1,0,1,0,0
31133594,2019,"INTRODUCTION:
Child malnutrition continues to be a significant global public health concern. Nutrition-related interventions have changed and diversified over the last two decades, with increasing emphasis on nutrition-sensitive programmes that address underlying determinants of child malnutrition. Cash transfer programmes (CTPs) are used with increasing popularity in lower-income and middle-income countries to improve both food/nutrition insecurity and resilience. Available studies, however, provide mixed findings on the outcomes of CTPs for child nutritional status. This review is the first stage of a research project to develop evidence-informed theories of how CTPs affect child malnutrition. These will be empirically tested in the field and contribute to a better understanding of how, why, for whom and in what circumstances CTPs can be implemented to optimise impacts on child nutritional status.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS:
This realist review is informed by available standards for realist reviews and follows a five-step process. In step 1, an initial scoping of literature identified potential contextual factors and underlying mechanisms that influence nutritional outcomes, and potential theories developed to address our research question. In step 2, a systematic literature search using multiple databases will be undertaken with papers screened using defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. In step 3, included studies will be appraised, data extracted into a bespoke data extraction tool and used to test and further refine our explanatory framework. The fourth step will synthesise, using a mix of inductive and deductive analytical processes to identify patterns, link chains of inference and tracking and linking of articles. The final step involves dissemination of a preliminary theory for feedback prior to empirically testing it in Kenya and Ethiopia where large-scale CTPs are being implemented.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:
This review will not involve primary data collection. Findings will be presented in accordance with Realist and Meta-Narrative Evidence Synthesis: Evolving Standards guidelines and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

26041675,2015,"BACKGROUND:
Human milk is the gold standard of nutrition for infants, providing both protective and essential nutrients. Although much is known about milk from mothers giving birth to term infants, less is known about milk from mothers giving birth to premature infants. In addition, little is known about the composition and diversity of small molecules in these milks and how they change over the first month of lactation.
OBJECTIVE:
The objective was to understand how milk metabolites vary over the first month of lactation in mothers giving birth to term and preterm infants.
METHODS:
(1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics was used to characterize metabolites that were present in micromolar to molar concentrations in colostrum (day 0-5 postpartum), transition milk (day 14), and mature milk (day 28) from mothers who delivered term (n = 15) and preterm (n = 13) infants. Principal components analysis, linear mixed-effects models (LMMs), and linear models (LMs) were used to explore the relation between infant maturity and the postpartum day of collection of milk samples.
RESULTS:
By using a standard NMR metabolite library, 69 metabolites were identified in the milks, including 15 sugars, 23 amino acids and derivatives, 11 energy-related metabolites, 10 fatty acid-associated metabolites, 3 nucleotides and derivatives, 2 vitamins, and 5 bacteria-associated metabolites. Many metabolite concentrations followed a similar progression over time in both term and preterm milks, with more biological variation in metabolite concentrations in preterm milk. However, although lacto-N-neotetraose (LMM, P = 4.0 × 10(-5)) and lysine (LM, P = 1.5 × 10(-4)) significantly decreased in concentration in term milk over time, they did not significantly change in preterm milk.
CONCLUSIONS:
Overall, the metabolic profile of human milk is dynamic throughout the first month of lactation, with more variability in preterm than in term milk and subtle differences in some metabolite concentrations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01841268.

22029937,2011,"The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is structured into four domains (I-IV) with numerous genotype-specific nucleotides. It is unknown whether the polymorphisms confer genotype-specific functions to the 5'UTR. Using viable JFH1-based Core-NS2 recombinants, we developed and characterized HCV genotypes 1-7 recombinants with highly diverse 5'UTRs (genotypes 1a and 3a), 2a recombinants (J6/JFH1) with 5'UTR of genotypes 1-6 or with heterotypic chimeric (1a/3a and 3a/1a) 5'UTR domains I, II or III, and 1a recombinants with 5'UTR domain I of genotypes 1-6. All were fully functional in Huh7.5 cells; therefore, the 5'UTR apparently functions in a non-genotype-specific manner in HCV production in vitro. However, adenine at the 5'-terminus was required. We demonstrated that J6/JFH1 with 5'UTR of genotypes 1-6 responded similarly to interferon-α2b.

24139898,2013,"Mutation is a fundamental process in tumorigenesis. However, the degree to which the rate of somatic mutation varies across the human genome and the mechanistic basis underlying this variation remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we performed a cross-cancer comparison of 402 whole genomes comprising a diverse set of childhood and adult tumors, including both solid and hematopoietic malignancies. Surprisingly, we found that the inactive X chromosome of many female cancer genomes accumulates on average twice and up to four times as many somatic mutations per megabase, as compared to the individual autosomes. Whole-genome sequencing of clonally expanded hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy individuals and a premalignant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) sample revealed no X chromosome hypermutation.

11006464,2000,"Though many neuroscientific methods have been brought to bear in the search for functional specializations within prefrontal cortex, little consensus has emerged. To assess the contribution of functional neuroimaging, this article reviews patterns of frontal-lobe activation associated with a broad range of different cognitive demands, including aspects of perception, response selection, executive control, working memory, episodic memory and problem solving. The results show a striking regularity: for many demands, there is a similar recruitment of mid-dorsolateral, mid-ventrolateral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Much of the remainder of frontal cortex, including most of the medial and orbital surfaces, is largely insensitive to these demands. Undoubtedly, these results provide strong evidence for regional specialization of function within prefrontal cortex. This specialization, however, takes an unexpected form: a specific frontal-lobe network that is consistently recruited for solution of diverse cognitive problems.",1,0,1,0,0

If resource use and mate choice have a common genetic basis through pleiotropy or close linkage, the resulting genetic correlations can promote the joint evolution of specialization and reproductive isolation, facilitating speciation. Here we present a model of the role of genetic correlations in specialization and speciation, and test it by analysing the genetic architecture of key traits in two highly specialized host races of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum pisum; Hemiptera : Aphididae). We found several complexes of pleiotropic or closely linked quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect key traits in ways that would promote speciation: QTL with antagonistic effects on performance on the two hosts are linked to QTL that produce asortative mating (through habitat choice). This type of genetic architecture may be common in taxa that have speciated under divergent natural selection.",1,1,2,1,0
29777117,2018,"With the dramatic increase of the diversity and the sheer quantity of biological data generated, the construction of comprehensive signaling networks that include precise mechanisms cannot be carried out manually anymore. In this context, we propose a logic-based method that allows building large signaling networks automatically. Our method is based on a set of expert rules that make explicit the reasoning made by biologists when interpreting experimental results coming from a wide variety of experiment types. These rules allow formulating all the conclusions that can be inferred from a set of experimental results, and thus building all the possible networks that explain these results. Moreover, given an hypothesis, our system proposes experimental plans to carry out in order to validate or invalidate it. To evaluate the performance of our method, we applied our framework to the reconstruction of the FSHR-induced and the EGFR-induced signaling networks. The FSHR is known to induce the transactivation of the EGFR, but very little is known on the resulting FSH- and EGF-dependent network. We built a single network using data underlying both networks.

To account for these diverse effects, we propose a model that integrates social cognitive work with two prominent accounts of visual processing: perceptual learning and predictive coding. Our argument is that differential experience with a racial ingroup promotes both (a) perceptual enrichment, including richer, more well-integrated visual representations of ingroup relative to outgroup faces, and (b) expectancies that ingroup faces are normative, which influence subsequent visual processing. By allowing for ""top-down"" expectancy-based processes, this model accounts for both experience- and non-experience-based influences, such as motivation, context, and task instructions. Fundamentally, we suggest that we treat race as an important psychological dimension because it structures our social environment, which in turn structures mental representation.",1,1,4,3,3
26574590,2015,"OBJECTIVE:
This article describes the methods used and the program performance results for the first 5 years of newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) in California.
METHODS:
From July 16, 2007, to June 30, 2012, a total of 2,573,293 newborns were screened for CF by using a 3-step model: (1) measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen in all dried blood spot specimens; (2) testing 28 to 40 selected cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations in specimens with immunoreactive trypsinogen values ≥62 ng/mL (top 1.6%); and (3) performing DNA sequencing on specimens found to have only 1 mutation in step 2. Infants with ≥2 mutations/variants were referred to CF care centers for diagnostic evaluation and follow-up. Infants with 1 mutation were considered carriers and their parents offered telephone genetic counseling.
RESULTS:
Overall, 345 CF cases, 533 CFTR-related metabolic syndrome cases, and 1617 carriers were detected; 28 cases of CF were missed. Of the 345 CF cases, 20 (5.8%) infants were initially assessed as having CFTR-related metabolic syndrome, and their CF diagnosis occurred after age 6 months (median follow-up: 4.5 years). Program sensitivity was 92%, and the positive predictive value was 34%. CF prevalence was 1 in 6899 births. A total of 303 CFTR mutations were identified, including 78 novel variants. The median age at referral to a CF care center was 34 days (18 and 37 days for step 2 and 3 screening test-positive infants, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS:
The 3-step model had high detection and low false-positive levels in this diverse population.

Afimbrial adhesin is known to be one of the most prevalent virulence factors in uropathogenic Escherichia coli. A recent report showed that the new subtype afaE8 predominated in afa positive isolates from patients with pyelonephritis (55.6%), suggesting that this subtype may be an important factor in ascending urinary tract infections.
METHODS:
A total of 457 E. coli strains consisting, of 194, 76 and 107 isolates from patients with cystitis, pyelonephritis and prostatitis, respectively, and 80 isolates from the rectal flora of healthy individuals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction to determine the afa operon as well as afaE subtypes.
RESULTS:
We identified 32 afa positive isolates of 377 strains (8.5%) and 2 of 80 strains (2.5%) from urinary tract infection isolates and normal flora, respectively. When afaE subtypes were determined, the afaE3 subtype predominated in afa positive isolates from cystitis (64.7%), pyelonephritis (66.7%) and prostatitis (50%). However, the afaE8 subtype was absent from urinary tract infection isolates, while only 1 isolate from the stool of a healthy adult harbored this subtype.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our data show that the afaE3 subtype predominated in pyelonephritis as well as in other urinary tract infections, indicating that the afa gene may be important in urinary tract infection. However, the distribution of afaE subtypes may be diverse in different areas of the world.

30925195,2019,"BACKGROUND:
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication following general anaesthesia. It may be associated with patient dissatisfaction, increased costs of treatment, and unintended admission to hospital.Supplemental intravenous crystalloid administration in the perioperative period may be a simple intervention to prevent PONV.
OBJECTIVE:
To assess whether supplemental intravenous crystalloid administration prevents PONV in patients undergoing surgical procedures under general anaesthesia.
METHODS:
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August 2018), Embase (1947 to August 2018), and the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1971 to August 2018). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing or unpublished completed studies (August 2018), handsearched three major journals (British Journal of Anaesthesia, European Journal of Anaesthesiology, and Anesthesiology; August 2018), and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.
METHODS:
We included randomized controlled trials of participants older than six months undergoing surgical procedures under general anaesthesia and given supplemental perioperative intravenous crystalloids, defined as a volume larger than that received by a comparator group, to prevent PONV.
METHODS:
We used the standard methodological procedures described by Cochrane.
RESULTS:
We included 41 studies (4224 participants). Participants underwent ambulatory or short length of stay surgical procedures, and were predominantly American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class I or II. There is one study awaiting classification and three ongoing studies. All studies took place in surgical centres, and were conducted in geographically diverse settings. Risk of bias was generally unclear across all domains.Supplemental intravenous crystalloid administration probably reduces the cumulative risk of postoperative nausea (PON) (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.75; 18 studies; 1766 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). When the postoperative period was divided into early (first six hours postoperatively) and late (at the time point closest to or including 24 hours postoperatively) time points, the intervention reduced the risk of early PON (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.78; 20 studies; 2310 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and late PON (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.69; 17 studies; 1682 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).Supplemental intravenous crystalloid administration probably reduces the risk of postoperative vomiting (POV) (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.63; 20 studies; 1970 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The intervention specifically reduced both early POV (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.76; 19 studies; 1998 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and late POV (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.79; 15 studies; 1403 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).Supplemental intravenous crystalloid administration probably reduces the need for pharmacologic treatment of PONV (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.76; 23 studies; 2416 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).The effect of supplemental intravenous crystalloid administration on the risk of unplanned postoperative admission to hospital is unclear (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.43; 3 studies; 235 participants; low-certainty evidence).No studies reported serious adverse events that may occur following supplemental perioperative intravenous crystalloid administration (i.e. admission to high-dependency unit, postoperative cardiac or respiratory complication, or death).
CONCLUSIONS:
There is moderate-certainty evidence that supplemental perioperative intravenous crystalloid administration reduces PON and POV, in ASA class I to II patients receiving general anaesthesia for ambulatory or short length of stay surgical procedures. The intervention probably also reduces the risk of pharmacologic treatment for PONV. The effect of the intervention on the risk of unintended postoperative admission to hospital is unclear. The risk of serious adverse events resulting from supplemental perioperative intravenous crystalloid administration is unknown as no studies reported this outcome. The one study awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.

33293078,2020,"BACKGROUND:
Molecular biomarkers aim to address the established limitations of clinicopathologic factors to accurately risk stratify patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Questions remain as to whether sufficient evidence supports adoption of these biomarkers for clinical use.
OBJECTIVE:
To perform a systematic review of the available evidence supporting the clinical utility of the Decipher genomic classifier (GC).
METHODS:
The review was performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines by searching PubMed and conference abstracts from January 2010 to June 2020. Evidence was then graded using the criteria of Simon et al (Simon RM, Paik S, Hayes DF. Use of archived specimens in evaluation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers. J Natl Cancer Inst 2009;101:1446-52) and American Urology Association (AUA) criteria.
RESULTS:
In total, 42 studies and 30407 patients were included. GC performance data were available for localized, postprostatectomy, nonmetastatic castration-resistant, and metastatic hormone-sensitive PCa as part of retrospective studies (n=12141), prospective registries (n=17053), and prospective and post hoc randomized trial analyses (n=1213). In 32 studies (n=12600), the GC was independently prognostic for all study endpoints (adverse pathology, biochemical failure, metastasis, and cancer-specific and overall survival) on multivariable analysis and improved the discrimination over standard of care in 24 studies (n=8543). GC use changed the management in active surveillance (number needed to test [NNT]=9) and postprostatectomy (NNT=1.5-4) settings in five studies (n=4331). Evidence strength was levels 1 and 2 by the Simon criteria for all disease states other than high-risk PCa, and grades A and B by AUA criteria depending on disease state.
CONCLUSIONS:
Consistent data are now present from diverse levels of evidence, which when viewed together, have demonstrated clinical utility of the GC in PCa. The utility of the GC is strongest for intermediate-risk PCa and postprostatectomy decision-making.
UNASSIGNED:
In this paper, we review the evidence of the Decipher genomic classification tool for men with prostate cancer. We found consistent evidence that the test helps identify which cancers are more or less aggressive, which in turn aids in personalized treatment decision-making.

8906501,1996,"The central nervous system interacts with the immune system to coordinate several components of the acute phase response, although the specific neuroanatomical pathways that mediate these responses are still uncharacterized. However, neurons in both the autonomic and endocrine components of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) are characteristically activated in different models of immune stimulation. In the current study, we have used intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 5 or 125 micrograms/kg) to induce the acute phase response. We subsequently coupled immunohistochemistry for Fos (as a marker of neuronal activation) with retrograde transport of the neuroanatomical tracer cholera toxin-b from the PVH. Several of the activated cell groups directly projected to the paraventricular nucleus, including the visceromotor (infralimbic) cortex, median preoptic nucleus, ventromedial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, parabrachial nucleus, ventrolateral medulla, and nucleus of the solitary tract. These findings indicate that immune system stimulation activates cell groups from multiple nervous system levels that project to the paraventricular nucleus. We hypothesize that the activation of specific autonomic and endocrine elements of the PVH may be due to the activity of distinct afferents that converge on the PVH from multiple components of the central autonomic control system. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the PVH plays a key role in integrating diverse physiological cues into the varied manifestations that constitute the cerebral component of the acute phase response.",1,0,1,0,0
12511598,2003,"Telomere dysfunction arising from mutations in telomerase or in telomere capping proteins leads to end-to-end chromosome fusions. Paradoxically, the Ku7080 heterodimer, essential for nonhomologous end-joining double-strand break repair, is also found at telomeres, and in mammals it is required to prevent telomere fusion. Previously, we showed that inactivation of Ku70 in Arabidopsis results in telomere lengthening. Here, we have demonstrated that this telomere elongation is telomerase dependent. Further, we found that the terminal 3' G overhang was significantly extended in ku70 mutants and in plants deficient in both Ku70 and the catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT), implying that Ku is needed for proper maintenance of the telomeric C-rich strand. Consistent with inefficient C-strand maintenance, telomere shortening was accelerated in ku70 tert double mutants, and the onset of a terminal sterile phenotype was reached two to three times faster than in tert single mutants. Unexpectedly, abundant anaphase bridges were found in terminal plants harboring critically shortened telomeres, indicating that Ku is not required for the formation of end-to-end chromosome fusions in telomerase-deficient Arabidopsis. Together, these findings define Ku70 as a gene in higher eukaryotes required for maintenance of the telomeric C-rich strand and underscore the complexity and diversity of molecular interactions at telomeres.",1,0,1,0,0

22905214,2012,"BACKGROUND:
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the major mechanisms contributing to microbial genome diversification. A number of computational methods for finding horizontally transferred genes have been proposed in the past decades; however none of them has provided a reliable detector yet. In existing parametric approaches, only one single compositional property can participate in the detection process, or the results obtained through each single property are just simply combined. It's known that different properties may mean different information, so the single property can't sufficiently contain the information encoded by gene sequences. In addition, the class imbalance problem in the datasets, which also results in great errors for the gene detection, hasn't been considered by the published methods. Here we developed an effective classifier system (Hgtident) that used support vector machine (SVM) by combining unusual properties effectively for HGT detection.
RESULTS:
Our approach Hgtident includes the introduction of more representative datasets, optimization of SVM model, feature selection, handling of imbalance problem in the datasets and extensive performance evaluation via systematic cross-validation methods. Through feature selection, we found that JS-DN and JS-CB have higher discriminating power for HGT detection, while GC1-GC3 and k-mer (k = 1, 2, …, 7) make the least contribution. Extensive experiments indicated the new classifier could reduce Mean error dramatically, and also improve Recall by a certain level. For the testing genomes, compared with the existing popular multiple-threshold approach, on average, our Recall and Mean error was respectively improved by 2.81% and reduced by 26.32%, which means that numerous false positives were identified correctly.
CONCLUSIONS:
Hgtident introduced here is an effective approach for better detecting HGT. Combining multiple features of HGT is also essential for a wider range of HGT events detection.

29141016,2017,"Intestinal microbe-host interactions can affect the feed efficiency (FE) of chickens. As inconsistent findings for FE-associated bacterial taxa were reported across studies, the present objective was to identify whether bacterial profiles and predicted metabolic functions that were associated with residual feed intake (RFI) and performance traits in female and male chickens were consistent across two different geographical locations. At six weeks of life, the microbiota in ileal, cecal and fecal samples of low (n = 34) and high (n = 35) RFI chickens were investigated by sequencing the V3-5 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Location-associated differences in α-diversity and relative abundances of several phyla and genera were detected. RFI-associated bacterial abundances were found at the phylum and genus level, but differed among the three intestinal sites and between males and females. Correlation analysis confirmed that, of the taxonomically classifiable bacteria, Lactobacillus (5% relative abundance) and two Lactobacillus crispatus-OTUs in feces were indicative for high RFI in females (P < 0.05). In males, Ruminococcus in cecal digesta (3.1% relative abundance) and Dorea in feces (<0.1% relative abundance) were best indicative for low RFI, whereas Acinetobacter in feces (<1.5% relative abundance) related to high RFI (P < 0.05). Predicted metabolic functions in feces of males confirmed compositional relationships as functions related to amino acid, fatty acid and vitamin metabolism correlated with low RFI, whereas an increasing abundance of bacterial signaling and interaction (i.e. cellular antigens) genes correlated with high RFI (P < 0.05). In conclusion, RFI-associated bacterial profiles could be identified across different geographical locations. Results indicated that consortia of low-abundance taxa in the ileum, ceca and feces may play a role for FE in chickens, whereby only bacterial FE-associations found in ileal and cecal digesta may serve as useful targets for dietary strategies.",1,1,8,0,0
28056945,2017,"BACKGROUND:
Maternal and child malnutrition is widely prevalent in low and middle income countries. In Pakistan, widespread food insecurity and malnutrition are the main contributors to poor health, low survival rates and the loss of human capital development. The nutritional status trends among children exhibit a continuous deteriorating with rates of malnutrition exceeding the WHO critical threshold. With the high prevalence of maternal and child malnutrition, it is important to identify effective preventative approaches, especially for reducing stunting in children under-five years of age. The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of food-based interventions to prevent stunting in children under-five years.
METHODS:
A mixed methods study design will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of food-based interventions to prevent stunting among children under-five years in districts Thatta and Sujawal, Sindh Province, Pakistan. The study will include cross sectional surveys, a community-based cluster randomized controlled trial and a process evaluation. The study participants will be pregnant women, lactating mothers and children under-five years. The cross-sectional surveys will be conducted with 7360 study participants at baseline and endline. For the randomized control trial, 5000 participants will be recruited and followed monthly for compliance of food-based supplements, dietary diversity, pregnancy outcomes, and maternal and child morbidity and mortality. Anthropometric measurements and hemoglobin levels will be measured at baseline, quarterly and at endline. The interventions will consist of locally produced lipid-based nutrient supplement (Wawamum) for children 6-23 months, micronutrient powders for children 24-59 months, and wheat soya blends for pregnant and lactating mothers. Government lady health workers will deliver interventions to participants. The effectiveness of the project will be measured in terms of the impact of the proposed interventions on stunting, nutritional status, micronutrient deficiencies, and other key indicators of the participants. The process evaluation will assess the acceptability, feasibility and potential barriers of project implementation through focus group discussions, key informant interviews and household surveys. Data analysis will be conducted using STATA version 12.
DISCUSSION:
There is considerable evidence on the effectiveness of food-based interventions in managing stunting in developing countries. However, these studies do not account for the local environmental factors and widespread nutrient deficiencies in Pakistan. These studies are often conducted in controlled environments, where the results cannot be generalized to programs operating under field conditions. The findings of this study will provide sufficient evidence to develop policies and programs aimed to prevent stunting in children 6-59 months and to improve maternal and child health and growth outcomes in poor resource settings.

HOTAIR and the ratio of FOXA1 to FOXA2 are negatively correlated. HOTAIR knockdown inhibits migration and invasion. HOTAIR is associated with LSH, and this association linked with the binding of LSH in the promoter of FOXA1, not FOXA2. Targeted inhibition of HOTAIR suppresses the migratory and invasive properties.

While many studies have been conducted in genetic variation underlying lipid levels, they mainly comprise individuals of European ancestry and thus their transferability to non-European populations is unclear. We performed genome-wide (GWAS) and imputed transcriptome-wide association studies of four lipid traits in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos cohort (HCHS/SoL, n = 11,103), replicated top hits in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, n = 3,855), and compared the results to the larger, predominantly European ancestry meta-analysis by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC, n = 196,475). In our GWAS, we found significant SNP associations in regions within or near known lipid genes, but in our admixture mapping analysis, we did not find significant associations between local ancestry and lipid phenotypes.

Factors associated with increased willingness to participate in these trials were awareness of current HIV vaccine efforts, realization of importance of vaccine for self, concern about adverse events and altruism.",1,1,5,0,1
20160063,2010,"OBJECTIVE:
Prevalent gene fusions in prostate cancer involve androgen-regulated promoters (primarily TMPRSS2) and ETS transcription factors (predominantly ETS-regulated gene (ERG)], which result in tumor selective overexpression of ERG in two thirds of patients. Because diverse genomic fusion events lead to ERG overexpression in prostate cancer, we reasoned that it may be more practical to capture such alterations using an assay targeting ERG sequences retained in such gene fusions. This study evaluates the potential of an assay quantitating ERG mRNA in post-digital rectal exam (DRE) urine for improving prostate cancer detection.
METHODS:
Patients scheduled to undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the prostate were prospectively enrolled. On the day of biopsy, patients provided a urine sample immediately following a DRE. Urine ERG mRNA was measured and normalized to urine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA using the DTS 400 system. Demographic traits, clinical characteristics and biopsy results were analyzed for association with urine ERG score.
RESULTS:
The study was conducted on 237 patients. Prostate cancer was shown on biopsy in 40.9% of study subjects. A higher urine ERG score associated significantly with malignancy on biopsy (P = 0.0145), but not with clinical stage or Gleason score. Urine ERG score performed best in Caucasians and in men with a PSA of <or=4 ng/mL (area under the curve = 0.8).
CONCLUSIONS:
A higher urine ERG score in post-DRE urine is associated with the diagnosis of prostate cancer on biopsy. Urine ERG score performed particularly well in men with a PSA of <or=4.0 ng/mL, a segment of the screening population in which further diagnostic markers are needed to determine in whom biopsy should be done.

28581401,2017,"PURPOSE:
To prospectively evaluate cognitive function and intracranial failure patterns after hippocampal-sparing prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
METHODS AND MATERIALS:
Adults with limited-stage SCLC, achieving a complete response to chemoradiotherapy and no brain metastases, were eligible. Patients received PCI 25 Gy/10 fractions, with a mean hippocampal dose limited to <8 Gy and ≥90% of the brain receiving 90% of the prescription. A diverse battery of neuropsychological testing was performed at baseline and 6 and 12 months after PCI. Brain MRI scans were performed at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The primary endpoint was memory measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised Delayed Recall at 6 months after PCI. The 25-Gy arm of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol 0212 was used as a reference of potential efficacy. Development of intracranial metastases was recorded. Overall survival and progression-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS:
Eight men and 12 women with a median age of 61 years enrolled. Two-year overall survival was 88% (95% confidence interval 68%-100%). There was no significant decline in performance between baseline and 6 or 12 months for any of the tests. The association between baseline intelligence quotient and change in performance on testing was not significant. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed asymptomatic brain metastases at a cumulative rate of 20%, with no concurrent extracranial progression. Two patients developed a metastasis in the under-dosed region. Neither involved the dentate gyrus, but 1 involved the avoidance region. Both patients concurrently developed additional metastasis in fully treated brain regions. There were 2 neurologic deaths.
CONCLUSIONS:
This prospective study suggests a potential benefit of hippocampal sparing in limiting the neuropsychological sequelae of brain radiation, but with a risk of failures in the spared region. These data strongly support continued enrollment on ongoing cooperative group randomized trials. Clinical Trials registration number: NCT01797159.

20152018,2010,"BACKGROUND:
There is only limited evidence available on how best to prevent childhood obesity and community-based interventions hold promise, as several successful interventions have now been published. The Victorian Government has recently funded six disadvantaged communities across Victoria, Australia for three years to promote healthy eating and physical activity for children, families, and adults in a community-based participatory manner. Five of these intervention communities are situated in Primary Care Partnerships and are the subject of this paper. The interventions will comprise a mixture of capacity-building, environmental, and whole-of-community approaches with targeted and population-level interventions. The specific intervention activities will be determined locally within each community through stakeholder and community consultation. Implementation of the interventions will occur through funded positions in primary care and local government. This paper describes the design of the evaluation of the five primary care partnership-based initiatives in the 'Go for your life' Health Promoting Communities: Being Active Eating Well (HPC:BAEW) initiative.
METHODS:
A mixed method and multi-level evaluation of the HPC:BAEW initiative will capture process, impact and outcome data and involve both local and state-wide evaluators. There will be a combined analysis across the five community intervention projects with outcomes compared to a comparison group using a cross-sectional, quasi-experimental design. The evaluation will capture process, weight status, socio-demographic, obesity-related behavioral and environmental data in intervention and comparison areas. This will be achieved using document analysis, paper-based questionnaires, interviews and direct measures of weight, height and waist circumference from participants (children, adolescents and adults).
CONCLUSIONS:
This study will add significant evidence on how to prevent obesity at a population level in disadvantaged and ethnically diverse communities. The outcomes will have direct influence on policy and practice and guide the development and implementation of future obesity prevention efforts in Australia and internationally.

The design of appropriate three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds is crucial for generating bio-inspired replacement tissues. These scaffolds are primarily composed of degradable or non-degradable biomaterials and can be employed as cells, growth factors, or drug carriers. Naturally derived and synthetic biomaterials have been widely used for these purposes, but the ideal biomaterial remains to be found. Researchers from diversified fields have attempted to design and fabricate novel biomaterials, aiming to find novel theranostic approaches for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Since no single biomaterial has been found to possess all the necessary characteristics for an ideal performance, over the years scientists have tried to develop composite biomaterials that complement and combine the beneficial properties of multiple materials into a superior matrix. Herein, we highlight the structural features and performance of various biomaterials and their application in regenerative medicine and for enhanced tissue engineering approaches.",1,0,1,0,0
23597916,2013,"The growing evidence base for biomedical HIV prevention interventions - such as oral pre-exposure prophylaxis, microbicides, male circumcision, treatment as prevention, and eventually prevention vaccines - has given rise to concerns about the ways in which users of these biomedical products may adjust their HIV risk behaviors based on the perception that they are prevented from infection. Known as risk compensation, this behavioral adjustment draws on the theory of ""risk homeostasis,"" which has previously been applied to phenomena as diverse as Lyme disease vaccination, insurance mandates, and automobile safety. Little rigorous evidence exists to answer risk compensation concerns in the biomedical HIV prevention literature, in part because the field has not systematically evaluated the study designs available for testing these behaviors. The goals of this Commentary are to explain the origins of risk compensation behavior in risk homeostasis theory, to reframe risk compensation as a testable response to the perception of reduced risk, and to assess the methodological rigor and ethical justification of study designs aiming to isolate risk compensation responses. Although the most rigorous methodological designs for assessing risk compensation behavior may be unavailable due to ethical flaws, several strategies can help investigators identify potential risk compensation behavior during Phase II, Phase III, and Phase IV testing of new technologies. Where concerns arise regarding risk compensation behavior, empirical evidence about the incidence, types, and extent of these behavioral changes can illuminate opportunities to better support the users of new HIV prevention strategies. This Commentary concludes by suggesting a new way to conceptualize risk compensation behavior in the HIV prevention context.",1,1,2,0,0

The physiological role of galanin remains unclear, with different effects being observed when porcine and rat galanin have been used in various animal model systems and in human studies. Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding human galanin and galanin mRNA associated peptide (GMAP) from both pituitary and neuroblastoma sources has revealed a unique and unexpected structure. In contrast to porcine, bovine and rodent galanin, human galanin lacks a carboxy-terminal amide. By analogy to other neurohormones, the absence of carboxy-terminal amidation would be expected to have significant effects on functional properties such as affinity for different receptor subtypes and physiological half life, and may be responsible for the species specificity observed in the action of galanin.",1,0,1,0,0

15466938,2004,"GH plays a pivotal role in regulating body growth and development, which is modulated by sex steroids. A close interplay between estrogen and GH leads to attainment of gender-specific body composition during puberty. The physiological basis of the interaction is not well understood. Most previous studies have focused on the effects of estrogen on GH secretion. There is also strong evidence that estrogen modulates GH action independent of secretion. Oral but not transdermal administration of estrogen impairs the metabolic action of GH in the liver, causing a fall in IGF-I production and fat oxidation. This results in a loss of lean tissue and a gain of body fat in postmenopausal women and an impairment of GH effect in hypopituitary women on GH replacement. The negative metabolic sequelae are potentially important because of the widespread use of oral estrogen and estrogen-related compounds. Estrogen affects GH action at the level of receptor expression and signaling. More recently, estrogen has been shown to inhibit Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling by GH via the induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling-2, a protein inhibitor for cytokine signaling. This represents a novel paradigm of steroid regulation of cytokine receptors and is likely to have significance for a diverse range of cytokine function.",1,1,5,0,0
22942431,2012,"Virus-specific CD4(+) T cells play a central role in control of viral pathogens including JC polyoma virus (JCV) infection. JCV is a ubiquitous small DNA virus that leads to persistent infection of humans with no clinical consequences. However, under circumstances of immunocompromise, it is able to cause an opportunistic and often fatal infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML has emerged as a serious adverse event in multiple sclerosis patients treated with the anti-VLA-4 mAb natalizumab, which selectively inhibits cell migration across the blood-brain barrier and the gut's vascular endothelium thus compromising immune surveillance in the CNS and gut. In a multiple sclerosis patient who developed PML under natalizumab treatment and a vigorous immune response against JCV after Ab washout, we had the unique opportunity to characterize in detail JCV-specific CD4(+) T cell clones from the infected tissue during acute viral infection. The in-depth analysis of 14 brain-infiltrating, JCV-specific CD4(+) T cell clones demonstrated that these cells use an unexpectedly broad spectrum of different strategies to mount an efficient JCV-specific immune response including TCR bias, HLA cross-restriction that increases avidity and influences in vivo expansion, and a combination of Th1 and Th1-2 functional phenotypes. The level of combinatorial diversity in TCR- and HLA-peptide interactions used by brain-infiltrating, JCV-specific CD4(+) T cells has not, to our knowledge, been reported before in humans for other viral infections and confirms the exceptional plasticity that characterizes virus-specific immune responses.",1,0,1,0,0
12450882,2002,"Evidence is emerging that dietary phytoestrogens play a beneficial role in obesity and diabetes. Nutritional intervention studies performed in animals and humans suggest that the ingestion of soy protein associated with isoflavones and flaxseed rich in lignans improves glucose control and insulin resistance. In animal models of obesity and diabetes, soy protein has been shown to reduce serum insulin and insulin resistance. In studies of human subjects with or without diabetes, soy protein also appears to moderate hyperglycemia and reduce body weight, hyperlipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia, supporting its beneficial effects on obesity and diabetes. However, most of these clinical trials were relatively short and involved a small number of patients. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the beneficial effects of soy protein and flaxseed are due to isoflavones (daidzein and genistein), lignans (matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol), or some other component. Isoflavones and lignans appear to act through various mechanisms that modulate pancreatic insulin secretion or through antioxidative actions. They may also act via estrogen receptor-mediated mechanisms. Some of these actions have been shown in vitro, but the relevance of these studies to in vivo disease is not known. The diversity of cellular actions of isoflavones and lignans supports their possible beneficial effects on various chronic diseases.

29627371,2018,"Progressive loss of organ function in most organs is associated with fibrosis, a tissue state associated with abnormal matrix buildup. If highly progressive, the fibrotic process eventually leads to organ failure and death. Fibrosis is a basic connective tissue lesion defined by the increase in the amount of fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) components in a tissue or organ. In addition, intrinsic changes in important structural cells can induce the fibrotic response by regulating the differentiation, recruitment, proliferation and activation of extracellular matrix-producing myofibroblasts. ECM enzymes belonging to the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and lysyl oxidases (LOXs) play a crucial role in ECM remodeling and regeneration. MMPs have a catalytic role in degradation of ECM, whereas LOX/LOXLs mediate ECM, especially collagen, cross-linking and stiffening. Importantly, enzymes from both families are elevated during the fibrotic response to tissue injury and its resolution. Yet, the apparent molecular competition or antagonistic activities of these enzyme families during the various stages of fibrosis is often overlooked. In this review, we discuss the diverse roles of MMPs and LOX/LOXL2 in chronic organ fibrosis. Finally, we review contemporary therapeutic strategies for fibrosis treatment, based on neutralization of MMP and LOX activity, as well as the development of novel drug delivery approaches.",1,0,1,0,0

The dissemination properties of antimicrobial resistance genes are supported by their detection in a diverse population of bacteria, including strains isolated from the environment. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) collected from a river ecosystem in the Barcelona metropolitan area (Spain). Identification of β-lactamases and other resistance determinants was determined as was the antimicrobial susceptibility profile. Moreover, screening of virulence factors, plasmid addiction systems, plasmid partition systems and replicon typing was performed. The results identified 8 isolates belonging to different species (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica). The most prevalent enzyme was KPC-2 (n = 6), followed by VIM-1 (n = 2) and IMI-2 (n = 1), whereas no OXA-48-type was detected. In addition, one strain was positive for both KPC-2 and VIM-1 enzymes. All the carbapenemase-encoding plasmids carried at least one plasmid addiction or partition system, being vagCD and parAB the most frequently detected, respectively. E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates carried a low number of virulence-associated factors and none of the detected clones has previously been identified in the clinical setting. These findings support the high dissemination potential of the carbapanemase-encoding genes and reinforce the idea that the environment is another reservoir that may play an important role in the capture, selection and dissemination of carbapenem resistance genes.",1,0,1,0,1
8059728,1994,"Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PC), an uncommon cause of peripartum heart failure, is defined as a cardiomyopathy presenting in the last trimester of pregnancy or the first 6 months postpartum, without evidence of preexisting cardiovascular disease. The etiology of PC and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) remains uncertain. Several reports have addressed possible differences in clinical presentation and prognosis between these groups. A relatively high incidence of myocarditis has been recently reported in patients with PC, raising the possibility that this may represent a distinct difference between this condition and IDC. A retrospective review of endomyocardial biopsy specimens from 34 patients fulfilling the criteria for a diagnosis of PC was therefore performed to further evaluate this finding. Results indicate a lower incidence of myocarditis (8.8%, 3 of 34) than that reported in other studies.

30451922,2018,"Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) are third generation solar cells used as an alternative to traditional silicon solar cells. DSSCs are characterized by their durability, easy handling and ability to perform better under diverse lighting conditions which makes them an ideal choice for indoor applications. However, DSSCs suffer from several limitations including low efficiencies, susceptibility to electrolyte leakage under extreme weather conditions, and the need for expensive materials and fabrication techniques which limits their large-scale industrial applications. Addressing these limitations through efficient design and manufacturing techniques are critical in ensuring that the DSSCs transform from the current small-scale laboratory levels to sizeable industrial production. This research attempts to address some of these significant limitations by introducing the concepts of nature-inspired fractal-based design followed by the additive manufacturing process to fabricate cost-effective, flexible counter electrodes for DSSCs. The new conceptual fractal-based design counter electrodes overcome the limitations of conventional planar designs by significantly increasing the number of active reaction sites which enhances the catalytic activity thereby improving the performance. The fabrication of these innovative fractal designs is realized through cost-effective manufacturing techniques including additive manufacturing and selective electrochemical co-deposition processes. The results of the study suggest that the fractal-based counter electrodes perform better than conventional designs. Additionally, the fractal designs and additive manufacturing technology help in addressing the problems of electrolyte leakage, cost of fabrication, and scalability of DSSCs.",1,0,1,0,0

1590992,1992,"Parasitic protozoa and helminths are a diverse group of organisms which together form a major cause of infectious disease in humans and livestock. Studies in animal models have revealed that T lymphocytes and the cytokines they produce play a crucial role in determining the outcome of parasitic infection in terms of both protective immunity and immunopathology. Of particular interest is recent evidence that different parasitic infections in the context of different host genetic background can trigger polarized CD4+ T cell subset responses. The set of cytokines produced by these different T helper responses, in turn, can have opposing effects on the parasite, resulting in either control of infection or promotion of disease. Moreover, cytokines produced by one CD4+ subset can block either the production and/or activity of the cytokines produced by the other subset. The establishment of this state of cross-regulation may be important for parasite survival. CD8+ T cells also appear to play a dual effector/regulatory role in parasite immunity and immunopathology, although the mechanisms underlying their induction and function are less well understood. CD(8+)-mediated cytolytic killing functions have now been demonstrated against a number of different intracellular protozoa, although IFN-gamma produced by the same effector cells may also be critical in host community.

To monitor the potential transport of bacteria originated from fresh or dry manure through aerosols on a dairy, we identified by 16S rRNA sequencing, bacteria in aerosols collected within 2 to 3 meters from dairy cows at two dairies. Gram-positive Firmicutes were predominant in aerosols from a dairy in Sonoma, California, and surrounded by vineyards, in contrast to sequences of Gram-negative Proteobacteria predominant in aerosols from a dairy in Modesto, California, also surrounded by other dairies. Although Firmicutes represented approximately 50% of the 10 most abundant sequences, aerosols from the Sonoma dairy also contained sequences of Bacteriodetes and Actinobacteria, identified previously with animal feces. While none of the top 10 sequences from fresh or dry manure from Modesto dairy were detected in aerosols, two of the sequences from the phylum Bacteriodetes and one from class Clostridia from fresh manure were detected in aerosols from Sonoma. Interestingly, none of the sequences from dry manure were in the top 10 sequences in aerosols from both dairies. The 10 most abundant sequences in aerosols from the Modesto dairy were all from Proteobacteria and nearly half of them were from genus Massilia, which have been isolated previously from immune-compromised people and aerosols. We conclude that the predominant bacteria in aerosols are diverse among locations and that they do not reflect the predominant species of bacteria present in cow feces and/or in close proximity to cows. These results suggest that the aerosol sequences did not originate from manure. Large volumes of aerosols would be required to determine if bacterial sequences from aerosols could be used to track bacteria in manure to crops grown in proximity.",1,0,1,0,2

Although most infections are asymptomatic, immunocompetent hosts devote an extraordinary amount of immune resources to virus control. To increase our understanding of CMV immunobiology in an animal model, we used a genomic approach to comprehensively map the C57BL/6 CD8 T cell response to murine CMV (MCMV). Responses to 27 viral proteins were detectable directly ex vivo, the most diverse CD8 T cell response yet described within an individual animal. Twenty-four peptide epitopes were mapped from 18 Ags, which together account for most of the MCMV-specific response. Most Ags were from genes expressed at early times, after viral genes that interfere with Ag presentation are expressed, consistent with the hypothesis that the CD8 T cell response to MCMV is largely driven by cross-presented Ag. Titration of peptide epitopes in a direct ex vivo intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed a wide range of functional avidities, with no obvious correlation between functional avidity and the strength of the response. The immunodominance hierarchy varied only slightly between mice and between experiments. However, H-2(b)-expressing mice with different genetic backgrounds responded preferentially to different epitopes, indicating that non-MHC-encoded factors contribute to immunodominance in the CD8 T cell response to MCMV.",1,0,1,0,0

Although a number of conserved transcriptional regulators of CSMN and CPN development have been identified in vertebrates, none are unique to mammals and most are coexpressed across multiple projection neuron subtypes. Here, we discover 17 CSMN-enriched microRNAs (miRNAs), 15 of which map to a single genomic cluster that is exclusive to eutherians. One of these, miR-409-3p, promotes CSMN subtype identity in part via repression of LMO4, a key transcriptional regulator of CPN development. In vivo, miR-409-3p is sufficient to convert deep-layer CPN into CSMN.

15534116,2004,"OBJECTIVE:
Antiandrogens are routinely used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Although they are known to prevent activation of the androgen receptor (AR), little is known about the mechanisms involved. This report represents the first study of the localization of wild-type AR following expression at physiologic relevant levels in prostate cells and treatment with androgen and antiandrogens.
METHODS:
We have characterized a cellular model for prostate cancer using in situ cellular fractionation, proteomics, and confocal microscopy and investigated the effect of antiandrogens in clinical use on the subcellular localization of the AR.
RESULTS:
Different antiandrogens have diverse effects on the subcellular localization of the AR. Treatment with androgen results in translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm, whereas the antiandrogens hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide lead to reversible association with the nuclear matrix. In contrast, treatment with the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate results in AR association with cytoplasmic membranes and irreversible retention within the cytoplasm. In addition, we demonstrate that AR translocation requires ATP and the cytoskeleton, regardless of ligand.
CONCLUSIONS:
These results reveal that not all antiandrogens work via the same mechanism and suggest that an informed sequential treatment regime may benefit prostate cancer patients. The observed subnuclear and subcytoplasmic associations of the AR suggest new areas of study to investigate the role of the AR in the response and resistance of prostate cancer to antiandrogen therapy.

Phosphorylation of eIF2 [eIF2(alphaP)] is critical for translational control in diverse settings including nutrient deprivation, viral infection and memory formation. eIF5 functions in start site selection as a GTPase accelerating protein (GAP) for the eIF2.GTP.tRNA(i)(Met) ternary complex within the ribosome-bound pre-initiation complex. Here we define new regulatory functions of eIF5 in the recycling of eIF2 from its inactive eIF2.GDP state between successive rounds of translation initiation. First we show that eIF5 stabilizes the binding of GDP to eIF2 and is therefore a bi-functional protein that acts as a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). We find that this activity is independent of the GAP function and identify conserved residues within eIF5 that are necessary for this role. Second we show that eIF5 is a critical component of the eIF2(alphaP) regulatory complex that inhibits the activity of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. Together our studies define a new step in the translation initiation pathway, one that is critical for normal translational controls.",1,0,1,0,0
17054158,2006,"BACKGROUND:
The majority of the detected increment in dental caries is confined to pit and fissure surfaces of first molars. Application of pit and fissure sealants and topical fluorides are widely used procedures in the prevention of decay, and their effectiveness in caries prevention has been proved by systematic reviews.
OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of pit and fissure sealants with fluoride varnishes in the prevention of dental decay on occlusal surfaces.
METHODS:
Electronic searching was performed on the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (last update November 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 4), MEDLINE (from 1966 to December 2005), EMBASE (from 1974 to November 2004), SIGLE (from 1976 to December 2004), SCISEARCH, CAplus, INSPEC, JICST-EPLUS, NTIS, PASCAL (last update December 2004), DARE, NHS EED and HTA (last update November 2005). Reference lists from articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria in this review and from review articles based on the search of MEDLINE were searched for additional relevant articles. Conference abstracts published as books or journals and handsearched by the Cochrane Oral Health Group were also included.
METHODS:
The inclusion criteria for study selection were: random or quasi-random allocation study design; sealants versus fluoride varnish or sealants and fluoride varnish combination versus fluoride varnish alone; included studies included caries documentation on occlusal surfaces of permanent molars and the subjects were under 20 years of age. Both parallel and split-mouth study designs were accepted. The primary outcome of interest was the increment in the numbers of carious occlusal surfaces of premolars and molars. A study was excluded if sealants and fluoride varnish were not compared with each other.
METHODS:
Two review authors carried out the baseline searches, selecting the papers on the basis of the title, keywords and abstract and making decisions about the eligibility and data extractions. The same review authors assessed the methodological quality of all included studies: for example, the allocation concealment, blinding, and completeness of follow up. Authors of the studies were contacted for additional information. Risk ratios (RR) as effect estimates were calculated for the differences in whether surfaces were carious or not in the treatment groups, along with the appropriate standard errors and 95% confidence intervals (CI). No data could be combined or meta-analyses undertaken due to the clinical and methodological diversity between study designs.
RESULTS:
Four studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. Three of the four studies compared the effectiveness of sealants with fluoride varnish application, and one study compared the effectiveness of sealants and fluoride varnish combination with fluoride varnish alone. Results of two studies revealed the effectiveness of pit and fissure sealants to be statistically significantly higher than an application of fluoride varnish every 6 months in preventing occlusal decays of first molars at 23 months (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95) and at 9 years follow up (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.79). One of these studies was classed as at low risk of bias, one of moderate to high risk. One small study at moderate to high risk of bias failed to find a statistically significant difference between sealants and fluoride varnishes. One study of low risk of bias found a statistically significant difference in favour of the sealants and fluoride varnish combination compared with merely fluoride varnish at 24 months follow up with RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.61). The age of children in the included studies was 5 to 9 years. Allocation concealment was classified adequate in two of these four studies.
CONCLUSIONS:
There was some evidence of the superiority of pit and fissure sealants over fluoride varnish application in the prevention of occlusal decays. However, it remained unclear to what extent there is difference between the effectiveness of pit and fissure sealants and fluoride varnishes. Therefore, more high quality research is needed. No recommendations for the clinical practice could be given and the benefit of pit and fissure sealants and fluoride varnishes should be considered locally and individually.

10693659,2000,"OBJECTIVE:
This study is intended to resolve the disparity and reach consensus on issues regarding the treatment of children with isolated spleen or liver injuries. To maximize patient safety and assure efficient, cost-effective utilization of resources, it was essential to determine current practice.
METHODS:
Data from the case records of 856 children with isolated spleen or liver injury treated at 32 pediatric surgical centers from July 1995 to June 1997 were collected. The severity of injury was classified by computed tomography (CT) grade and the data analyzed for intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay, transfusion requirement, need for operation, pre- and postdischarge imaging, and restriction of physical activity. Patients with grade V injuries (2.8%) were excluded leaving 832 patients for detailed review. These data and available literature were analyzed for consensus by the 1998 APSA Trauma Committee.
RESULTS:
Resource utilization increased with injury severity (see Table 2). Based on the data analysis, literature search, and consensus conference, the authors propose guidelines (see Table 3) for the safe and optimal utilization of resources in routine cases. It is important to emphasize that no recommendation falls outside the 25th percentile of current practice at participating centers.
CONCLUSIONS:
Diversity of treatment, with attendant variation in resource utilization in children with isolated spleen and liver injury of comparable severity is confirmed. This analysis has stimulated a prospective outcomes study with the objective of validating the evidence-based guidelines proposed. This evidence-based study design can bring order and conformity to patient management resulting in optimal utilization of resources while maximizing patient safety.

23755263,2013,"Populations on islands often exhibit lower levels of genetic variation and ecomorphological divergence compared to their mainland relatives. While phenotypic differentiation in characters, such as size or shape among insular organisms, has been well studied, insular differentiation in quantitative reproductive traits involved in chemical communication has received very little attention to date. Here, we investigated the impact of insularity on two syntopic bumblebee species pairs: one including species that are phylogenetically related (Bombus terrestris and B. lucorum), and the other including species that interact ecologically (B. terrestris and its specific nest inquiline B. vestalis). For each bumblebee species, we characterized the patterns of variation and differentiation of insular (Corsican) vs. mainland (European) populations (i) with four genes (nuclear and mitochondrial, 3781 bp) and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results provide evidence for genetic differentiation in Corsican bumblebees and show that, contrary to theoretical expectations, island populations of bumblebees exhibit levels of genetic variation similar to the mainland populations. Likewise, our comparative chemical analyses of MMS indicate that Corsican populations of bumblebees are significantly differentiated from the mainland yet they hold comparative levels of within-population MMS variability compared to the mainland. Therefore, insularity has led Corsican populations to diverge both genetically and chemically from their mainland relatives, presumably through genetic drift, but without a decrease of genetic diversity in island populations. We hypothesize that MMS divergence in Corsican bumblebees was driven by a persistent lack of gene flow with mainland populations and reinforced by the preference of Corsican females for sympatric (Corsican) MMS. The impoverished Corsican bumblebee fauna has not led to relaxation of stabilizing selection on MMS but to consistent differentiation chemical reproductive traits on the island.",1,1,4,0,9
26411697,2015,"Unlike the advances generated on land, the knowledge of global diversity patterns in marine ecosystems is limited to a small number of studies. For sandy beaches, which dominate the world's ocean shores, previous meta-analyses highlighted the role of beach morphodynamics in explaining species richness patterns. Oceanographic variables and historical processes have not been considered, even though they could be main predictors of community structure. Our work, based on 256 sandy beaches around the world, analysed species richness considering for the first time temperature, salinity and primary productivity. Biogeographic units (realms, provinces and ecoregions) were used to incorporate historical factors in modelling processes. Ecoregions, which implicitly include isolation and coastal complexity among other historical geographic factors, best represented trends in species richness worldwide. Temperature was a main predictor of species richness, which increased from temperate to tropical sandy beaches. Species richness increased with tide range and towards wide beaches with gentle slopes and fine grains, which is consistent with the hypothesis that habitat availability has an important role in structuring sandy beach communities. The role of temperature and habitat availability suggests that ocean warming and sea level rise could affect the distribution of obligate species living in these narrow ecosystems. ",1,0,1,0,0

18689832,2008,"BACKGROUND:
Coding-region mutations in human genes are responsible for a diverse spectrum of diseases and phenotypes. Among lesions that have been studied extensively, there are insights into several of the biochemical functions disrupted by disease-causing mutations. Currently, there are more than 60 000 coding-region mutations associated with inherited disease catalogued in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, August 2007) and more than 70 000 polymorphic amino acid substitutions recorded in dbSNP (dbSNP, build 127). Understanding the mechanism and contribution these variants make to a clinical phenotype is a formidable problem.
RESULTS:
In this study, we investigate the role of phosphorylation in somatic cancer mutations and inherited diseases. Somatic cancer mutation datasets were shown to have a significant enrichment for mutations that cause gain or loss of phosphorylation when compared to our control datasets (putatively neutral nsSNPs and random amino acid substitutions). Of the somatic cancer mutations, those in kinase genes represent the most enriched set of mutations that disrupt phosphorylation sites, suggesting phosphorylation target site mutation is an active cause of phosphorylation deregulation. Overall, this evidence suggests both gain and loss of a phosphorylation site in a target protein may be important features for predicting cancer-causing mutations and may represent a molecular cause of disease for a number of inherited and somatic mutations.

32324761,2020,"BACKGROUND:
Large-scale emergency assistance programmes in Somalia use a variety of transfer modalities including in-kind food provision, food vouchers, and cash transfers. Evidence is needed to better understand whether and how such modalities differ in reducing the risk of acute malnutrition in vulnerable groups, such as the 800,000 pregnant and lactating women affected by the 2017/18 food crisis.
METHODS:
Changes in diet and acute malnutrition status were assessed among pregnant and lactating women receiving similarly sized household transfers over a four-month period (total value of ~US$450 per household) delivered either as food vouchers or as mixed transfers consisting of in-kind food, vouchers, and cash. Baseline and endline comparisons were conducted for 514 women in Wajid, Somalia. Primary study outcomes were Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women, meal frequency, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), with MUAC<21.0 cm classified as acute malnutrition. Adjusted analyses consisted of difference-in-difference analysis using linear and logistic regression models with inverse probability weighting based on propensity scores to account for the non-randomized design.
FINDINGS:
No significant difference in change in dietary quality was observed between food voucher and mixed transfer recipients; a significant difference in change in mean meal frequency was observed (0.3 meals/day, CI: 0.1-0.5, p = 0.001) and the mixed transfer group had significantly greater meal frequency at endline (p<0.001). Mean MUAC increased significantly among both voucher (0.9cm, CI: 0.6-1.3, p = 0.001) and mixed transfer recipients (1.3cm, CI: 1.1-1.5, p = 0.001) over the intervention period in adjusted analysis, however, the difference in magnitude of change between the two groups was not statistically significant (0.4cm, CI: -0.1-0.08, p = 0.086).
CONCLUSIONS:
Within the context of the 2017/18 Somalia food crisis, the modality of assistance provided to pregnant and lactating women (mixed transfers or food-vouchers) made no difference in preventing acute malnutrition and protecting nutritional status.

29373972,2018,"BACKGROUND:
Sex pheromone communication in moths has attracted the attention of evolutionary biologists due to the vast array of pheromone compounds used, addressing questions of how this diversity arose and how male reception has evolved in step with the female signal. Here we examine the role of changing gene expression in the evolution of mate recognition systems in leafroller moths, particularly focusing on genes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of sex pheromones in female pheromone glands and the peripheral reception repertoire in the antennae of males. From tissue-specific transcriptomes we mined and compared a database of genes expressed in the pheromone glands and antennae of males and females of four closely related species of leafroller moths endemic to New Zealand, Ctenopseutis herana and C. obliquana, and Planotortrix excessana and P. octo. The peculiarity of this group, compared to other Lepidoptera, is the use of (Z)-5-tetradecenyl acetate, (Z)-7-tetradecenyl acetate, and (Z)-8-tetradecenyl acetate as sex pheromone components.
RESULTS:
We identify orthologues of candidate genes from the pheromone biosynthesis pathway, degradation and transport, as well as genes of the periphery olfactory repertoire, including large families of binding proteins, receptors and odorant degrading enzymes. The production of distinct pheromone blends in the sibling species is associated with the differential expression of two desaturase genes, deast5 and desat7, in the pheromone glands. In male antennae, three odorant receptors, OR74, OR76a and OR30 are over-expressed, but their expression could not be clearly associated with the detection of species-specific pheromones components. In addition these species contain duplications of all three pheromone binding proteins (PBPs) that are also differentially expressed among species.
CONCLUSIONS:
While in females differences in the expression of desaturases may be sufficient to explain pheromone blend differences among these New Zealand leafroller species, in males differential expression of several genes, including pheromone binding proteins, may underpin differences in the response by males to changing pheromone components among the species.

23555001,2013,"OBJECTIVE:
There is strong evidence supporting the claim that endogenous cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) are key players in cardiac regeneration, but the anatomic source and phenotype of the master cardiac progenitors remains uncertain. Our aim was to investigate the different cardiac stem cell populations in the left atrial appendage (LAA) and their fates.
RESULTS:
We investigated the CPC content and profile of adult murine LAAs using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. We demonstrate that the LAA contains a large number of CPCs relative to other areas of the heart, representing over 20% of the total cell number. We grew two distinct CPC populations from the LAA by varying the degree of proteolysis. These differed by their histological location, surface marker profiles and growth dynamics. Specifically, CD45(pos) cells grew with milder proteolysis, while CD45(neg) cells grew mainly with more intense proteolysis. Both cell types could be induced to differentiate into cells with cardiomyocyte markers and organelles, albeit by different protocols. Many CD45(pos) cells expressed CD45 initially and rapidly lost its expression while differentiating.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our results demonstrate that the left atrial appendage plays a role as a reservoir of multiple types of progenitor cells in murine adult hearts. Two different types of CPCs were isolated, differing in their epicardial-myocardial localization. Considering studies demonstrating layer-specific origins of different cardiac progenitor cells, our findings may shed light on possible pathways to study and utilize the diversity of endogenous progenitor cells in the adult heart.

METHODS:
Fifty-two participants from a university cohort were selected. Vaginal swabs were self-collected every 3-months for up to 12 months with 184 specimens analysed. The vaginal microbiota was characterised using Roche 454 V3/4 region 16S rRNA sequencing, and G.vaginalis clade typing by qPCR.
RESULTS:
A Lactobacillus crispatus dominated vaginal microbiota was associated with Caucasian ethnicity (adjusted relative risk ratio[ARRR] = 7.28, 95%CI:1.37,38.57,p = 0.020). An L.iners (ARRR = 17.51, 95%CI:2.18,140.33,p = 0.007) or G.vaginalis (ARRR = 14.03, 95%CI:1.22,160.69, p = 0.034) dominated microbiota was associated with engaging in penile-vaginal sex. Microbiota dominated by L.crispatus, L.iners or other lactobacilli exhibited greater longitudinal consistency of the bacterial communities present compared to ones dominated by heterogeneous non-lactobacilli (p<0.030); sexual activity did not influence consistency. Women who developed BV were more likely to have clade GV4 compared to those reporting no sex/practiced non-coital activities (OR = 11.82, 95%CI:1.87,74.82,p = 0.009). Specimens were more likely to contain multiple G.vaginalis clades rather than a single clade if women engaged in penile-vaginal sex (RRR = 9.55, 95%CI:1.33,68.38,p = 0.025) or were diagnosed with BV (RRR = 31.5, 95%CI:1.69,586.87,p = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS:
Sexual activity and ethnicity influenced the composition of the vaginal microbiota of these young, relatively sexually inexperienced women. Women had consistent vaginal microbiota over time if lactobacilli were the dominant spp. present. Penile-vaginal sex did not alter the consistency of microbial communities but increased G.vaginalis clade diversity in young women with and without BV, suggesting sexual transmission of commensal and potentially pathogenic clades.

Phellinus sulphurascens is a fungal pathogen that causes laminar root rot in conifers, one of the most damaging root diseases in western North America. Despite its importance as a forest pathogen, this fungus is still poorly studied at the genomic level. An understanding of the molecular events involved in establishment of the disease should help to develop new methods for control of this disease.
RESULTS:
We generated over 4600 expressed sequence tags from two cDNA libraries constructed using either mycelia grown on cellophane sheets and exposed to Douglas-fir roots or tissues from P. sulphurascens-infected Douglas-fir roots. A total of 890 unique genes were identified from the two libraries, and functional classification of 636 of these genes was possible using the Functional Catalogue (FunCat) annotation scheme. cDNAs were identified that encoded 79 potential virulence factors, including numerous genes implicated in virulence in a variety of phytopathogenic fungi. Many of these putative virulence factors were also among 82 genes identified as encoding putatively secreted proteins. The expression patterns of 86 selected fungal genes over 7 days of infection of Douglas-fir were examined using real-time PCR, and those significantly up-regulated included rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase, 1,4-benzoquinone reductase, a cyclophilin, a glucoamylase, 3 hydrophobins, a lipase, a serine carboxypeptidase, a putative Ran-binding protein, and two unknown putatively secreted proteins called 1 J04 and 2 J12. Significantly down-regulated genes included a manganese-superoxide dismutase, two metalloproteases, and an unknown putatively secreted protein called Ps0058.
CONCLUSIONS:
This first collection of Phellinus sulphurascens EST sequences and its annotation provide an important resource for future research aimed at understanding key virulence factors of this forest pathogen. We examined the expression patterns of numerous fungal genes with potential roles in virulence, and found a collection of functionally diverse genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated during infection of Douglas-fir seedling roots by P. sulphurascens.

METHODS:
Online archives from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) 2015 and 2018 Annual Meetings were reviewed for female representation among oral abstract authors, nominated STS leadership positions, and The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (ATS) Editorial Board. Differences were assessed with χ
RESULTS:
In 2015, 36 of 336 (10.7%) presenting and senior authors were women (P < .001 vs men): 22 (13.1%) were presenting authors, and 14 (8.3%) were senior authors (P < .001 vs men for both). Between 2015 and 2018, no increase was observed in female authorship, with 29 of 278 (10.4%) authorship positions filled by women (P < .001 vs men). In 2018, women filled 18 (12.9%) presenting and 11 (7.9%) senior author positions. This lack of change in representation over time held true in the adult cardiac, congenital, and general thoracic subspecialties. Nevertheless, there was a trend toward women more often occupying nominated STS leadership positions in 2018 (68 [12.3%] vs 40 [9.1%], P = .092).

The molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid induction of heterotypic protective immunity to RV, which provides the basis for the efficacy of licensed monovalent RV vaccines, have remained unknown for more than 30 years. We used RV-specific single cell-sorted intestinal B cells from human adults, barcode-based deep sequencing of antibody repertoires, monoclonal antibody expression, and serologic and functional characterization to demonstrate that infection-induced heterotypic immunoglobulins (Igs) primarily directed to VP5*, the stalk region of the RV attachment protein, VP4, are able to mediate heterotypic protective immunity. Heterotypic protective Igs against VP7, the capsid glycoprotein, and VP8*, the cell-binding region of VP4, are also generated after infection; however, our data suggest that homotypic anti-VP7 and non-neutralizing VP8* responses occur more commonly in people. These results indicate that humans can circumvent the extensive serotypic diversity of circulating RV strains by generating frequent heterotypic neutralizing antibody responses to VP7, VP8*, and most often, to VP5* after natural infection.

31350531,2019,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are enriched at barrier surfaces of the mammalian body where they rapidly respond to host, microbial or environmental stimuli to promote immunity or tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, ILCs are dysregulated in multiple human diseases. Over the past decade, substantial advances have been made in identifying the heterogeneity and functional diversity of ILCs, which have revealed striking similarities to T cell subsets. However, emerging evidence indicates that ILCs also have a complex role in directly influencing the adaptive immune response in the context of development, homeostasis, infection or inflammation. In turn, adaptive immunity reciprocally regulates ILCs, which indicates that these interactions are a crucial determinant of immune responses within tissues. Here, we summarize our current understanding of functional interactions between ILCs and the adaptive immune system, discuss limitations and future areas of investigation, and consider the potential for these interactions to be therapeutically harnessed to benefit human health.",1,0,1,0,0

29146646,2017,"OBJECTIVE:
Applications for surgical training have declined over the last decade, and anecdotally the costs of training at the expense of the surgical trainee are rising. We aimed to quantify the costs surgical trainees are expected to cover for postgraduate training.
METHODS:
Prospective, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study.
METHODS:
A non-mandatory online questionnaire for UK-based trainees was distributed nationally. A similar national questionnaire was distributed for Ireland, taking into account differences between the healthcare systems. Only fully completed responses were included.
RESULTS:
There were 848 and 58 fully completed responses from doctors based in the UK and Ireland, respectively. Medical students in the UK reported a significant increase in debt on graduation by 55% from £17 892 (2000-2004) to £27 655 (2010-2014) (p<0.01). 41% of specialty trainees in the UK indicated that some or all of their study budget was used to fund mandatory regional teaching. By the end of training, a surgical trainee in the UK spends on average £9105 on courses, £5411 on conferences and £4185 on exams, not covered by training budget. Irish trainees report similarly high costs. Most trainees undertake a higher degree during their postgraduate training. The cost of achieving the mandatory requirements for completion of training ranges between £20 000 and £26 000 (dependent on specialty), except oral and maxillofacial surgery, which is considerably higher (£71 431).
CONCLUSIONS:
Medical students are graduating with significantly larger debt than before. Surgical trainees achieve their educational requirements at substantial personal expenditure. To encourage graduates to pursue and remain in surgical training, urgent action is required to fund the mandatory requirements and annual training costs for completion of training and provide greater transparency to inform doctors of what their postgraduate training costs will be. This is necessary to increase diversity in surgery, reduce debt load and ensure surgery remains a popular career choice.

29050909,2017,"The auditory pathway is widely distributed throughout the brain, and is perhaps one of the most interesting networks in the context of neuroplasticity. Accurate mapping of neural activity in the entire pathway, preferably noninvasively, and with high resolution, could be instrumental for understanding such longitudinal processes. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has clear advantages for such characterizations, as it is noninvasive, provides relatively high spatial resolution and lends itself for repetitive studies, albeit relying on an indirect neurovascular coupling to deliver its information. Indeed, fMRI has been previously used to characterize the auditory pathway in humans and in rats. In the mouse, however, the auditory pathway has insofar only been mapped using manganese-enhanced MRI. Here, we describe a novel setup specifically designed for high-resolution mapping of the mouse auditory pathway using high-field fMRI. Robust and consistent Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) responses were documented along nearly the entire auditory pathway, from the cochlear nucleus (CN), through the superior olivary complex (SOC), nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (LL), inferior colliculus (IC) and the medial geniculate body (MGB). By contrast, clear BOLD responses were not observed in auditory cortex (AC) in this study. Diverse BOLD latencies were mapped ROI- and pixel-wise using coherence analysis, evidencing different averaged BOLD time courses in different auditory centers. Some degree of tonotopy was identified in the IC, SOC, and MGB in the pooled dataset though it could not be assessed per subject due to a lack of statistical power. Given the importance of the mouse model in plasticity studies, animal models, and optogenetics, and fMRI's potential to map dynamic responses to specific cues, this first fMRI study of the mouse auditory pathway paves the way for future longitudinal studies studying brain-wide auditory-related activity in vivo.",1,0,1,0,0

27729582,2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is positively associated with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke risk factors. However, understanding the relation between HGF and stroke is in its infancy. Therefore, we sought to examine the association of circulating HGF with incident stroke using data from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). We hypothesized that circulating HGF would be positively associated with an increased risk of stroke.
METHODS:
Participants aged 45 to 84 years (n=6711) had HGF measured between 2000 and 2002 and were followed for incident stroke through 2013 (n=233). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident stroke. A secondary analysis stratified results by adjudicated stroke type (n=183 ischemic; n=39 hemorrhagic; n=11 other).
RESULTS:
After adjustment for potential confounding variables, risk of stroke was 17% higher with each standard deviation increase in HGF (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.34). This association was mainly driven by ischemic stroke and did not change on exclusion of cardioembolic strokes, although the number of excluded cases was small. The few hemorrhagic and other types of stroke were not associated with HGF.
CONCLUSIONS:
Circulating HGF was positively associated with the incidence of stroke in a diverse, population-based cohort of men and women from the United States. Our findings support the hypothesis that circulating HGF is a marker of endothelial damage and suggest that HGF may have utility as a prognostic marker of stroke risk.

15696159,2005,"The ubiquitously expressed c-Abl tyrosine kinase localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Nuclear c-Abl is activated by diverse genotoxic agents and induces apoptosis; however, the mechanisms that are responsible for nuclear targeting of c-Abl remain unclear. Here, we show that cytoplasmic c-Abl is targeted to the nucleus in the DNA damage response. The results show that c-Abl is sequestered into the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of c-Abl on Thr 735 functions as a site for direct binding to 14-3-3 proteins. We also show that, in response to DNA damage, activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Jnk) induces phosphorylation of 14-3-3 proteins and their release from c-Abl. Together with these results, expression of an unphosphorylated 14-3-3 mutant attenuates DNA-damage-induced nuclear import of c-Abl and apoptosis. These findings indicate that 14-3-3 proteins are pivotal regulators of intracellular c-Abl localization and of the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress.",1,0,1,0,0

In this work, two isolated STLs 1β-hydroxy alantolactone (1) and ivangustin (2) were derivatized through diversity-oriented strategy, and in vitro cytotoxic activity assessments were conducted against six cell lines including HeLa, PC-3, HEp-2, HepG2, CHO and HUVEC. The cytotoxic structure-activity relationship showed that the double bond between C5 and C6 was beneficial to improve activity; C1-OH oxidized derivatives showed a slight stronger activity, comparable to the positive drug etoposide (VP-16). Yet, C1-OH esterified derivatives decreased the potency which were different from those of 1-O-acetylbritannilactone (ABL) reported previously by us, and C13-methylene reductive and spiro derivatives resulted in almost complete ablation of cytotoxic activity.

24146954,2013,"With the astonishing rate that genomic and metagenomic sequence data sets are accumulating, there are many reasons to constrain the data analyses. One approach to such constrained analyses is to focus on select subsets of gene families that are particularly well suited for the tasks at hand. Such gene families have generally been referred to as ""marker"" genes. We are particularly interested in identifying and using such marker genes for phylogenetic and phylogeny-driven ecological studies of microbes and their communities (e.g., construction of species trees, phylogenetic based assignment of metagenomic sequence reads to taxonomic groups, phylogeny-based assessment of alpha- and beta-diversity of microbial communities from metagenomic data). We therefore refer to these as PhyEco (for phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology) markers. The dual use of these PhyEco markers means that we needed to develop and apply a set of somewhat novel criteria for identification of the best candidates for such markers. The criteria we focused on included universality across the taxa of interest, ability to be used to produce robust phylogenetic trees that reflect as much as possible the evolution of the species from which the genes come, and low variation in copy number across taxa. We describe here an automated protocol for identifying potential PhyEco markers from a set of complete genome sequences. The protocol combines rapid searching, clustering and phylogenetic tree building algorithms to generate protein families that meet the criteria listed above. We report here the identification of PhyEco markers for different taxonomic levels including 40 for ""all bacteria and archaea"", 114 for ""all bacteria (greatly expanding on the ∼30 commonly used), and 100 s to 1000 s for some of the individual phyla of bacteria. This new list of PhyEco markers should allow much more detailed automated phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology analyses of these groups than possible previously. ",1,0,1,0,0
27906965,2016,"OBJECTIVE:
Research suggested a positive association between physical fitness and neurocognitive functioning in children. Aim of the present study is to investigate possible dose-response relationships between diverse daily physical activities and a broad range of neurocognitive functions in preadolescent children. Furthermore, the relationship between several sedentary behaviours, including TV-watching, gaming and computer time, and neurocognitive functioning will be investigated in this group of children.
METHODS:
A total of 168 preadolescent boys, aged 8 to 12 years, were recruited from various locations, including primary schools, an amateur soccer club, and a professional soccer club, to increase variability in the amount of participation in sports. All children performed neurocognitive tasks measuring inhibition, short term memory, working memory, attention and information processing speed. Regression analyses examined the predictive power of a broad range of physical activities, including sports, active transport to school, physical education (PE), outdoor play, and sedentary behaviour such as TV-watching and gaming, for neurocognitive functioning.
RESULTS:
Time spent in sports significantly accounted for the variance in inhibition, short term memory, working memory and lapses of attention, where more time spent in sports was associated with better performance. Outdoor play was also positively associated with working memory. In contrast, time spent on the computer was negatively associated with inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS:
Results of the current study suggest a positive relationship between participation in sports and several important neurocognitive functions. Interventions are recommended to increase sports participation and to reduce sedentary behaviour in preadolescent children.

Recently, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) has emerged as an effective and robust method for the detection of cytogenetic aberrations in MM patients.

We firstly established the normal range of each of the 42 diagnostic probes using healthy donor samples. A total of 151 aberrations were detected in 59 patient samples, and 49/59 cases (83.1%) harbored at least one copy number variation. Overall, 0-7 aberrations were detected per case using MLPA, indicating the heterogeneity and complexity of MM cytogenetics. We showed the high efficiency of MLPA and the high congruency of the two methods to assess cytogenetic aberrations.

The capacity of these proteins to dimerize in various combinations complicates the analysis of their functional properties, however. To simplify the functional analysis of CREB dimers, we mutated selected residues within the leucine zipper region to generate proteins that could only heterodimerize. These mutants allowed us to determine whether phosphorylation of both CREB subunits was necessary for transcriptional activation. Our results reveal that hemiphosphorylated CREB dimers are half as active as fully phosphorylated dimers. It is possible, therefore, that the degree of phosphorylation of CREB complexes could modulate the transcriptional responses of specific genes to cAMP.",1,0,1,0,0

To date, there are no reports on GRAS family proteins expressed in Salvia miltiorrhiza. In this study, 28 ESTs that contained the GRAS domain were identified from a S. miltiorrhiza cDNA library. Of these, full-length sequences of five genes were cloned and sequence analysis indicated that all five proteins contain only one GRAS domain and therefore, belong to the GRAS family. The five genes were designated S. miltiorrhiza GRAS1-5 (SmGRAS1-5), which belong to groups I (SmGRAS2 and SmGRAS4), II (SmGRAS3), III (SmGRAS1), and VIII (SmGRAS5) respectively. Additionally, SmGRAS1-5 have different expression patterns in the reed head, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots of S. miltiorrhiza. In this study, the expression of SmGRAS1-5 was sensitive to Gibberellin (GA) stress and that of SmGRAS1, SmGRAS4 and SmGRAS5 was sensitive to Ethephon (Eth) stress respectively. Moreover, S. miltiorrhiza copalyl diphosphate synthases 1 (SmCPS1) and S. miltiorrhiza kaurene synthase like 1 (SmKSL1), which are two key enzymes gene in the diterpenoid biosynthesis pathway, were also response to GA and Eth stress. In addition, Dihydrotanshinone (DT-I) and Tanshinone I (T-I) content were enhanced by GA and Eth stress, Tanshinone IIA (T-IIA) content was increased by GA stress, and the accumulation of Cryptotanshinone (CT) was insensitive to both GA and Eth stress.

31150626,2019,"The scaling of organelles with cell size is thought to be exclusive to eukaryotes. Here, we demonstrate that similar scaling relationships hold for the bacterial nucleoid. Despite the absence of a nuclear membrane, nucleoid size strongly correlates with cell size, independent of changes in DNA amount and across various nutrient conditions. This correlation is observed in diverse bacteria, revealing a near-constant ratio between nucleoid and cell size for a given species. As in eukaryotes, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio in bacteria varies greatly among species. This spectrum of nucleocytoplasmic ratios is independent of genome size, and instead it appears linked to the average population cell size. Bacteria with different nucleocytoplasmic ratios have a cytoplasm with different biophysical properties, impacting ribosome mobility and localization.

16872498,2006,"BACKGROUND:
Alternative polyadenylation is a widespread mechanism contributing to transcript diversity in eukaryotes. Over half of mammalian genes are alternatively polyadenylated. Our understanding of poly(A) site evolution is limited by the lack of a reliable identification of conserved, equivalent poly(A) sites among species. We introduce here a working definition of conserved poly(A) sites as sites that are both (i) properly aligned in human and mouse orthologous 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and (ii) supported by EST or cDNA data in both species.
RESULTS:
We identified about 4800 such conserved poly(A) sites covering one third of the orthologous gene set studied. Characteristics of conserved poly(A) sites such as processing efficiency and tissue-specificity were analyzed. Conserved sites show a higher processing efficiency but no difference in tissular distribution when compared to non-conserved sites. In general, alternative poly(A) sites are species-specific and involve minor, non-conserved sites that are unlikely to play essential roles. However, there are about 500 genes with conserved tandem poly(A) sites. A significant fraction of these conserved tandems display a conserved arrangement of major/minor sites in their 3' UTR, suggesting that these alternative 3' ends may be under selection.
CONCLUSIONS:
This analysis allows us to identify potential functional alternative poly(A) sites and provides clues on the selective mechanisms at play in the appearance of multiple poly(A) sites and their maintenance in the 3' UTRs of genes.

1944571,1991,"Length polymorphisms within simple-sequence loci occur ubiquitously in non-coding eukaryotic DNA and can be highly informative in the analysis of natural populations. Simple-sequence length polymorphisms (SSLP) in the long-finned pilot whale Globicephala melas (Delphinidae) have provided useful information on the mating system as well as on the genetic structure of populations. We have therefore tested whether the polymerase chain reaction primers designed for Globicephala could also be used to uncover variability in other whale species. Homologous loci could indeed be amplified from a diverse range of whales, including all toothed (Odontoceti) and baleen whales (Mysticeti) tested. Cloning and sequencing these loci from 11 different species revealed an unusually high conservation of sequences flanking the simple-sequence stretches, averaging 3.2% difference over 35-40 Myr. This represents the lowest divergence rate for neutral nucleotide positions found for any species group so far and raises the possible need for a re-evaluation of the age of the modern whales. On the other hand, the high conservation of non-coding sequences in whales simplifies the application of SSLP DNA fingerprinting in cetacean species, as primers designed for one species will often uncover variability in other species.",1,1,2,0,0
20520727,2010,"BACKGROUND:
The domestication of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) was a complex process punctuated by episodes of introgressive hybridization among and between subpopulations. Deep genetic divergence between the two main varietal groups (Indica and Japonica) suggests domestication from at least two distinct wild populations. However, genetic uniformity surrounding key domestication genes across divergent subpopulations suggests cultural exchange of genetic material among ancient farmers.
RESULTS:
In this study, we utilize a novel 1,536 SNP panel genotyped across 395 diverse accessions of O. sativa to study genome-wide patterns of polymorphism, to characterize population structure, and to infer the introgression history of domesticated Asian rice. Our population structure analyses support the existence of five major subpopulations (indica, aus, tropical japonica, temperate japonica and GroupV) consistent with previous analyses. Our introgression analysis shows that most accessions exhibit some degree of admixture, with many individuals within a population sharing the same introgressed segment due to artificial selection. Admixture mapping and association analysis of amylose content and grain length illustrate the potential for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in domesticated plant populations.
CONCLUSIONS:
Genes in these regions control a myriad of traits including plant stature, blast resistance, and amylose content. These analyses highlight the power of population genomics in agricultural systems to identify functionally important regions of the genome and to decipher the role of human-directed breeding in refashioning the genomes of a domesticated species.

31501889,2019,"Large phenotypically diverse research cohorts with both amyloid and tau PET have only recently come into existence. Our objective was to determine relationships between the bivariate distribution of amyloid-β and tau on PET and established clinical syndromes that are relevant to cognitive ageing and dementia. All individuals in this study were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a longitudinal population-based study of cognitive ageing, or the Mayo Alzheimer Disease Research Center, a longitudinal study of individuals recruited from clinical practice. We studied 1343 participants who had amyloid PET and tau PET from 2 April 2015 to 3 May 2019, and met criteria for membership in one of five clinical diagnostic groups: cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, probable dementia with Lewy bodies, and Alzheimer clinical syndrome. We examined these clinical groups in relation to the bivariate distribution of amyloid and tau PET values. Individuals were grouped into amyloid (A)/tau (T) quadrants based on previously established abnormality cut points of standardized uptake value ratio 1.48 (A) and 1.33 (T). Individual participants largely fell into one of three amyloid/tau quadrants: low amyloid and low tau (A-T-), high amyloid and low tau (A+T-), or high amyloid and high tau (A+T+). Seventy per cent of cognitively unimpaired and 74% of FTD participants fell into the A-T- quadrant. Participants with mild cognitive impairment spanned the A-T- (42%), A+T- (28%), and A+T+ (27%) quadrants. Probable dementia with Lewy body participants spanned the A-T- (38%) and A+T- (44%) quadrants. Most (89%) participants with Alzheimer clinical syndrome fell into the A+T+ quadrant. These data support several conclusions. First, among 1343 participants, abnormal tau PET rarely occurred in the absence of abnormal amyloid PET, but the reverse was common. Thus, with rare exceptions, amyloidosis appears to be required for high levels of 3R/4R tau deposition. Second, abnormal amyloid PET is compatible with normal cognition but highly abnormal tau PET is not. These two conclusions support a dynamic biomarker model in which Alzheimer's disease is characterized first by the appearance of amyloidosis and later by tauopathy, with tauopathy being the proteinopathy associated with clinical symptoms. Third, bivariate amyloid and tau PET relationships differed across clinical groups and thus have a role for clarifying the aetiologies underlying neurocognitive clinical syndromes.",1,1,2,0,0

18829799,2008,"OBJECTIVE:
Our aims were (1) to describe rates of suboptimal control and controller medication underuse in a diverse population of children with asthma and (2) to identify potentially modifiable parental behaviors and beliefs associated with these outcomes.
METHODS:
We conducted telephone interviews with parents of 2- to 12-year-old children with persistent asthma, in a Medicaid plan and a large provider group. Suboptimal control was defined as >or=4 symptom days, >or=1 symptom night, or >or=4 albuterol use days in the previous 2 weeks. Controller medication underuse was defined as suboptimal control and parent report of <6 days/week of inhaled steroid use. Multivariate analyses identified factors that were independently associated with suboptimal control and controller medication underuse.
RESULTS:
Of the 754 study children, 280 (37%) had suboptimal asthma control; this problem was more common in Hispanic children (51%) than in black (37%) or white (32%) children. Controller medication underuse was present for 133 children (48% of those with suboptimal asthma control and 18% overall). Controller medication underuse was more common among Hispanic (44%) and black (34%) children than white (22%) children. In multivariate analyses, suboptimal control was associated with potentially modifiable factors including low parental expectations for symptom control and high levels of worry about competing household priorities. Controller medication underuse was associated with potentially modifiable factors including parental estimation of asthma control that was discordant with national guidelines and no set time to administer asthma medications.
CONCLUSIONS:
Deficiencies in asthma control and controller medication use are associated with potentially modifiable parental beliefs, which seem to mediate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in suboptimal control and controller medication underuse.

30852534,2019,"INTRODUCTION:
Mental illness and HIV remain prevalent as chronic and stigmatised conditions and a global public health concern. Disability-adjusted life-years due to comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions and HIV are rising. Occupational justice and social inclusion emphasise the importance of equity and the utility of resources and opportunities for all to engage in diverse, healthy and meaningful activities. However, succinct conceptualisation of social inclusion and occupational justice, including the relationship between these concepts is still limited. This hampers their effective utilisation in research and practice. Here, we present our scoping review protocol to appraise literature to describe and explain the state of conceptualisation of occupational justice and social inclusion in relation to mental illness and HIV. We are aiming to review the definitions, current utilisation and relationships between occupational justice and social inclusion to inform further theorisation and practice application.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS:
This scoping review protocol follows existing guidelines for scoping reviews in occupational therapy with particular attention on Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) scoping review framework. We iteratively developed a search strategy and carried out our search using the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Academic Search Premier, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Africa-Wide Information, Humanities International Complete, Web of Science, PsychInfo and SocINDEX. To enhance the comprehensiveness of our search and capture all relevant information, we will also search a variety of grey literature sources. Two reviewers will independently screen eligible studies for inclusion. Bibliographic data, abstract content and aspects of the study design and findings will be extracted and thematically analysed.

29060733,2017,"Without any doubt, research in biomedical engineering and anesthesiology achieved diverse ground-breaking successes for the sake of patient safety and for optimization of medical treatment in the last decades. Particularly anesthesia has become increasingly comfortable and safer due to new monitoring devices and further techniques. However, assessment of pain still relies on self-reporting of the patient using a Numeric Rating Scale ranging from 0 to 10. Obviously, this method suffers from severe restraints when unconscious, anesthetized or uncooperative subjects or children are involved as patients. Furthermore, no continuous monitoring is available so that features like alerting telemetry are lacking. Several scientific groups and companies searched intensively for procedures to measure pain objectively. Skin conductance, heart rate variability and peripheral perfusion, among others, were used to develop new algorithms and devices. Up to date, none of these devices succeeded to enter in clinical routine. In this project, we used infrared thermography (IRT) to analyze facial expressions and further thermal-associated phenomena that are visible in recorded IRT sequences such as lacrimation and perspiration. By means of clinical observations, a number of IRT features were predefined that were expected to correlate with pain. The combination of those features led to the so-called ""Thermal-Associated Pain Intensity"" (TAPI) after normalization and transformation. The TAPI correlates significantly with the NRS and achieves a sensitivity of above 0.75 to detect pain.",1,1,2,0,0
24552445,2014,"BACKGROUND:
After the 2011 cluster of Hendra virus cases in horses in Australia, public health targeted education initiatives at people in the equine industry to reduce human exposure to potentially infected horses. 'Horse owners and Hendra Virus: A Longitudinal cohort study To Evaluate Risk' aims to enhance public health measures through improved understanding of Hendra virus risk perception and risk mitigation strategies among horse owners and horse care providers. This paper describes the stakeholder consultation that was undertaken to ensure the cohort study outcomes were relevant to diverse groups who play a role in Hendra virus policy development and implementation.
METHODS:
A two-round modified Delphi study with online questionnaires was conducted. In round one, stakeholders identified priority research areas. In round two, stakeholders rated and ranked topics that emerged from thematic analysis of the round one responses. Round two data were analysed using logistic regression.
RESULTS:
Of the 255 stakeholders contacted, 101 responded to round one. Over 450 topics were proposed. These were organized into 18 themes. Approximately two thirds of the round one respondents participated in round two. 'Hendra virus-related risk awareness and perception', 'personal health and safety', 'emergency preparedness', 'risk prevention, mitigation, and biosecurity', and 'Hendra virus vaccination in horses--attitudes/uptake' were the top five areas identified according to probability of being ranked extremely important.
CONCLUSIONS:
In this study, a modified Delphi approach was effective in guiding research into Hendra virus, a zoonotic disease of animal and human health significance. The findings support the notion that stakeholders should be engaged in zoonotic disease research priority setting. Such consultation will help to ensure that research initiatives are relevant and useful to stakeholders in the position to make use of new findings.

25058236,2014,"Patients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with inflammatory bowel disease (monogenic IBD). Patients with these disorders often develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood, along with endoscopic or histological features of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or IBD unclassified. Defects in interleukin-10 signaling have a Mendelian inheritance pattern with complete penetrance of intestinal inflammation. Several genetic defects that disturb intestinal epithelial barrier function or affect innate and adaptive immune function have incomplete penetrance of the IBD-like phenotype. Several of these monogenic conditions do not respond to conventional therapy and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Due to the broad spectrum of these extremely rare diseases, a correct diagnosis is frequently a challenge and often delayed. In many cases, these diseases cannot be categorized based on standard histological and immunologic features of IBD. Genetic analysis is required to identify the cause of the disorder and offer the patient appropriate treatment options, which include medical therapy, surgery, or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In addition, diagnosis based on genetic analysis can lead to genetic counseling for family members of patients. We describe key intestinal, extraintestinal, and laboratory features of 50 genetic variants associated with IBD-like intestinal inflammation. In addition, we provide approaches for identifying patients likely to have these disorders. We also discuss classic approaches to identify these variants in patients, starting with phenotypic and functional assessments that lead to analysis of candidate genes. As a complementary approach, we discuss parallel genetic screening using next-generation sequencing followed by functional confirmation of genetic defects. ",1,1,3,0,0
33225889,2020,"BACKGROUND:
Arachnids are important components of cave ecosystems and display many examples of troglomorphisms, such as blindness, depigmentation, and elongate appendages. Little is known about how the eyes of arachnids are specified genetically, let alone the mechanisms for eye reduction and loss in troglomorphic arachnids. Additionally, duplication of Retinal Determination Gene Network (RDGN) homologs in spiders has convoluted functional inferences extrapolated from single-copy homologs in pancrustacean models.
RESULTS:
We investigated a sister species pair of Israeli cave whip spiders, Charinus ioanniticus and C. israelensis (Arachnopulmonata, Amblypygi), of which one species has reduced eyes. We generated embryonic transcriptomes for both Amblypygi species, and discovered that several RDGN homologs exhibit duplications. We show that duplication of RDGN homologs is systemic across arachnopulmonates (arachnid orders that bear book lungs), rather than being a spider-specific phenomenon. A differential gene expression (DGE) analysis comparing the expression of RDGN genes in field-collected embryos of both species identified candidate RDGN genes involved in the formation and reduction of eyes in whip spiders. To ground bioinformatic inference of expression patterns with functional experiments, we interrogated the function of three candidate RDGN genes identified from DGE using RNAi in the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum. We provide functional evidence that one of these paralogs, sine oculis/Six1 A (soA), is necessary for the development of all arachnid eye types.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our work establishes a foundation to investigate the genetics of troglomorphic adaptations in cave arachnids, and links differential gene expression to an arthropod eye phenotype for the first time outside of Pancrustacea. Our results support the conservation of at least one RDGN component across Arthropoda and provide a framework for identifying the role of gene duplications in generating arachnid eye diversity.

10588195,1999,"Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) represent a chemically and pharmacologically diverse group of agents that are widely used for the treatment of hypertension and angina. A small number of retrospective, observational analyses have raised concern about a potential causal link between CCB use and an increased risk for cancer development. Despite the absence of cancer findings in extensive preclinical studies, it has been proposed that CCBs may work differently in humans by interfering with apoptosis, leading to an increased potential for abnormal cell proliferation and tumor growth. This biologic hypothesis has attracted considerable attention in the medical community but has not been critically evaluated. An analysis of the basic and clinical literature was conducted to examine biologic relationships among cell Ca2+ modulation, apoptosis, and cancer. In addition to a comprehensive review of the cellular and animal data, the results of large observational studies were included in this analysis. Results of this review demonstrated that the effects of CCBs on apoptosis are complex as both increases and decreases in intracellular Ca2+ have been linked to this form of programmed cell death. Most studies show that an effect (either positive or negative) of CCBs on apoptosis requires doses in the supra-pharmacologic range, and are therefore not clinically relevant. Results of large and methodologically robust observational studies fail to provide support for the hypothesis that CCB use is associated with an increased susceptibility for cancer incidence. A comprehensive analysis of the basic and clinical evidence does not support a causal relationship between the therapeutic use of CCBs and an increased incidence of cancer development as a result of interfering with apoptosis.",1,0,1,0,0
25593593,2014,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have become an increasingly important approach for eukaryotic geneticists, facilitating the identification of hundreds of genetic polymorphisms that are responsible for inherited diseases. Despite the relative simplicity of bacterial genomes, the application of GWASs to identify polymorphisms responsible for important bacterial phenotypes has only recently been made possible through advances in genome sequencing technologies. Bacterial GWASs are now about to come of age thanks to the availability of massive datasets, and because of the potential to bridge genomics and traditional genetic approaches that is provided by improving validation strategies. A small number of pioneering GWASs in bacteria have been published in the past 2 years, examining from 75 to more than 3,000 strains. The experimental designs have been diverse, taking advantage of different processes in bacteria for generating variation. Analysis of data from bacterial GWASs can, to some extent, be performed using software developed for eukaryotic systems, but there are important differences in genome evolution that must be considered. The greatest experimental advantage of bacterial GWASs is the potential to perform downstream validation of causality and dissection of mechanism. We review the recent advances and remaining challenges in this field and propose strategies to improve the validation of bacterial GWASs. ",1,1,2,0,0
29940275,2018,"OBJECTIVE:
This study was performed to investigate the effect of PD-L1 polymorphisms on the susceptibility and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Chinese Han population.
METHODS:
Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PD-L1 gene, including rs2297136 (C > T), rs4143815 (C > G), rs2890658 (A > C) and rs17718883 (C > G) were examined in 225 HCC patients and 200 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.
RESULTS:
Data revealed that the rs2297136 (C > T) SNP TT (p = 0.03) and rs4143815 (C > G) SNP GG genotypes (p < 0.001) were associated with significantly increased risks of HCC. No association was found between rs2890658 (A > C) SNP and HCC risk and this risk was significantly decreased in individuals with the rs17718883 SNP CG + GG genotype (p < 0.001). The rs2297136 (C > T) SNP CC + CT genotypes, the rs4143815 (C > G) CC genotype and the rs2890658 (A > C) AA genotype were associated with increased overall survival compared to their counterpart allelic genotypes (p < 0.001). The rs2890658 (A > C) SNP had no impact on the risk and prognosis of HCC (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS:
Our results indicated that three functional polymorphisms (rs2297136, rs4143815 and rs17718883) of the PD-L1 gene were associated with HCC risk and prognosis, suggesting that genetic variants of PD-L1 polymorphisms might be a possible prognostic marker for the prediction of HCC risk and development. Validation by a larger prospective study from a more diverse ethnic population is needed to confirm these findings.

So far, analyzing Th phenotypes or antigen specificities has yielded very few clues to pathogenesis. Here we adopt an alternative antigen-independent approach, analyzing T cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta usage/expansions in blood from 118 MG patients. We found major expansions (>or= five standard deviations above the mean of 118 healthy, individually age- and sex-matched controls) in diverse Vbeta in 21 patients (17.6%, p<0.001) among CD4+ T cells, and in 45 patients (38.1%, p<0.001) among CD8+ T cells. In informative probands, the expanded CD4+ cells consistently showed a Th cell phenotype (CD57+CXCR5+) and expressed Th1 cytokines. Furthermore, their expression of markers for activation, lymphocyte trafficking and B cell-activating ability persisted for >or=3 years. Surprisingly, we noted a selective decline in the expansions/their CD57 positivity while the probands' MG was improving. CDR3 spectratyping suggested mono- or oligoclonal origins, which were confirmed by the prevalent TCR Vbeta CDR3 sequences of Th cells cloned from repeat bleeds. Thus, our data provide evidence for persistent clonally expanded CD4+ B helper T cell populations in the blood of MG patients. These unexpected CD4+ expansions might hold valuable clues to MG immunopathogenesis.",1,1,3,0,0
24177592,2013,"Sugar cane processing sites are characterised by high sugar/hemicellulose levels, available moisture and warm conditions, and are relatively unexplored unique microbial environments. The PhyloChip microarray was used to investigate bacterial diversity and community composition in three Australian sugar cane processing plants. These ecosystems were highly complex and dominated by four main Phyla, Firmicutes (the most dominant), followed by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi. Significant variation (p < 0.05) in community structure occurred between samples collected from 'floor dump sediment', 'cooling tower water', and 'bagasse leachate'. Many bacterial Classes contributed to these differences, however most were of low numerical abundance. Separation in community composition was also linked to Classes of Firmicutes, particularly Bacillales, Lactobacillales and Clostridiales, whose dominance is likely to be linked to their physiology as 'lactic acid bacteria', capable of fermenting the sugars present. This process may help displace other bacterial taxa, providing a competitive advantage for Firmicutes bacteria. ",1,0,1,0,1

10377108,1999,"Haemophilus ducreyi, the etiologic agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer disease, produces a cell-associated hemolysin whose role in virulence is not well defined. Hemolysin is encoded by two genes, hhdA and hhdB, which, based on their homology to Serratia marcescens shlA and shlB genes, are believed to encode the hemolysin structural protein and a protein required for secretion and modification of this protein, respectively. In this study, we determined the prevalence and expression of the hemolysin genes in 90 H. ducreyi isolates obtained from diverse geographic locations from 1952 to 1996 and found that all strains contained DNA homologous to the hhdB and hhdA genes. In addition, all strains expressed a hemolytic activity. We also determined that hemolysin is expressed in vivo and is immunogenic, as indicated by the induction of antibodies to hemolysin in both the primate and rabbit disease models as well as in human patients with naturally acquired chancroid. Wild-type strain 35000 and isogenic hemolysin-negative mutants showed no difference in lesion development in the temperature-dependent rabbit model. However, immunization of rabbits with the purified hemolysin protein reduced the recovery of wild-type H. ducreyi, but not hemolysin-negative mutants, from lesions. Our study indicates that hemolysin is a possible candidate for vaccine development due to its immunogenicity, expression in vitro and in vivo by most, if not all, strains, and the effect of immunization on reducing the recovery of viable H. ducreyi in experimental disease in rabbits.",1,0,1,0,0
17224476,2007,"BACKGROUND:
Cardiac ion channelopathies are responsible for an ever-increasing number and diversity of familial cardiac arrhythmia syndromes. We describe a new clinical entity that consists of an ST-segment elevation in the right precordial ECG leads, a shorter-than-normal QT interval, and a history of sudden cardiac death.
RESULTS:
Eighty-two consecutive probands with Brugada syndrome were screened for ion channel gene mutations with direct sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed, and CHO-K1 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant CACNB2b (Ca(v beta2b)), CACNA2D1 (Ca(v alpha2delta1)), and CACNA1C tagged with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (Ca(v)1.2). Whole-cell patch-clamp studies were performed after 48 to 72 hours. Three probands displaying ST-segment elevation and corrected QT intervals < or = 360 ms had mutations in genes encoding the cardiac L-type calcium channel. Corrected QT ranged from 330 to 370 ms among probands and clinically affected family members. Rate adaptation of QT interval was reduced. Quinidine normalized the QT interval and prevented stimulation-induced ventricular tachycardia. Genetic and heterologous expression studies revealed loss-of-function missense mutations in CACNA1C (A39V and G490R) and CACNB2 (S481L) encoding the alpha1- and beta2b-subunits of the L-type calcium channel. Confocal microscopy revealed a defect in trafficking of A39V Ca(v)1.2 channels but normal trafficking of channels containing G490R Ca(v)1.2 or S481L Ca(v beta2b)-subunits.
CONCLUSIONS:
This is the first report of loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding the cardiac L-type calcium channel to be associated with a familial sudden cardiac death syndrome in which a Brugada syndrome phenotype is combined with shorter-than-normal QT intervals.

26779081,2016,"Music is a potent mood regulator that can induce relaxation and reduce anxiety in different situations. While several studies demonstrate that certain types of music have a subjective anxiolytic effect, the reported results from physiological responses are less conclusive. Virtual reality allows us to study diverse scenarios of real life under strict experimental control while preserving high ecological validity. We aimed to study the modulating effect of music on the anxiety responses triggered by an immersive virtual reality scenario designed to induce fear of heights. Subjects experienced a virtual scenario depicting an exterior elevator platform ascending and descending the total height of its 350 meters tall supporting structure. Participants were allocated to either a group that experienced the elevator ride with background music or without, in a between-groups design. Furthermore, each group included participants with different degrees of fear of heights, ranging from low to high fear. Recordings of heart rate, galvanic skin response, body balance, and head movements were obtained during the experiments. Subjective anxiety was measured by means of three questionnaires. The scenario produced significant changes in subjective and physiological measures, confirming its efficacy as a stressor. A significant increase in state anxiety was found between pre and post-assessment in the silence group, but not in the music group, indicating that post-stress recovery was faster in the musical group. Results suggest that music can ameliorate the subjective anxiety produced by fear of heights. ",1,0,1,0,0

We present microsatellite data on genetic parentage that show that seahorses mate size-assortatively in nature. We then develop a quantitative genetic model based on these empirical findings to demonstrate that sympatric speciation indeed can occur under this mating regime in response to weak disruptive selection on body size. We also evaluate phylogenetic evidence bearing on sympatric speciation by asking whether tiny seahorse species are sister taxa to large sympatric relatives. Overall, our results indicate that sympatric speciation is a plausible mechanism for the diversification of seahorses, and that assortative mating (in this case as a result of male parental care) may warrant broader attention in the speciation process for some other taxonomic groups as well.",1,1,4,0,0

22039450,2011,"BACKGROUND:
To date, 11 HIV-1 subtypes and 48 circulating recombinant forms have been described worldwide. The underlying reason why their distribution is so heterogeneous is not clear. Host genetic factors could partly explain this distribution. The aim of this study was to describe HIV-1 strains circulating in an unexplored area of Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and to assess the impact of optimal epitope mutations on HLA binding.
METHODS:
We recruited 125 chronically antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected subjects from five cities in the Mekong Delta. We performed high-resolution DNA typing of HLA class I alleles, sequencing of Gag and RT-Prot genes and phylogenetic analysis of the strains. Epitope mutations were analyzed in patients bearing the HLA allele restricting the studied epitope. Optimal wild-type epitopes from the Los Alamos database were used as reference. T-cell epitope recognition was predicted using the immune epitope database tool according to three different scores involved in antigen processing (TAP and proteasome scores) and HLA binding (MHC score).
RESULTS:
All sequences clustered with CRF01_AE. HLA class I genotyping showed the predominance of Asian alleles as A*11:01 and B*46:01 with a Vietnamese specificity held by two different haplotypes. The percentage of homology between Mekong and B consensus HIV-1 sequences was above 85%. Divergent epitopes had TAP and proteasome scores comparable with wild-type epitopes. MHC scores were significantly lower in divergent epitopes with a mean of 2.4 (±0.9) versus 2 (±0.7) in non-divergent ones (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS:
Our study confirms the wide predominance of CRF01_AE in the Mekong Delta where patients harbor a specific HLA pattern. Moreover, it demonstrates the lower MHC binding affinity among divergent epitopes. This weak immune pressure combined with a narrow genetic diversity favors immune escape and could explain why CRF01_AE is still predominant in Vietnam, particularly in the Mekong area.

12606571,2003,"Comparative studies on the ABC model of floral development have revealed extensive conservation of B and C class genes, but have failed to identify similar conservation for A class genes.

Antirrhinum has two genes corresponding to AP2, termed LIP1 and LIP2, both of which need to be inactivated to give a mutant phenotype. Analysis of interactions between LIP and class B/C genes shows that unlike AP2 in Arabidopsis, LIP genes are not required for repression of C in outer whorls of the flower. However, like AP2, LIP genes play a role in sepal, petal and ovule development, although some of their detailed effects are different, reflecting the diverse morphologies of Antirrhinum and Arabidopsis flowers.

25049384,2014,"The evolution of mitochondria and plastids from bacterial endosymbionts were key events in the origin and diversification of eukaryotic cells. Although the ancient nature of these organelles makes it difficult to understand the earliest events that led to their establishment, the study of eukaryotic cells with recently evolved obligate endosymbiotic bacteria has the potential to provide important insight into the transformation of endosymbionts into organelles. Diatoms belonging to the family Rhopalodiaceae and their endosymbionts of cyanobacterial origin (i.e., ""spheroid bodies"") are emerging as a useful model system in this regard. The spheroid bodies, which appear to enable rhopalodiacean diatoms to use gaseous nitrogen, became established after the divergence of extant diatom families. Here we report what is, to our knowledge, the first complete genome sequence of a spheroid body, that of the rhopalodiacean diatom Epithemia turgida. The E. turgida spheroid body (EtSB) genome was found to possess a gene set for nitrogen fixation, as anticipated, but is reduced in size and gene repertoire compared with the genomes of their closest known free-living relatives. The presence of numerous pseudogenes in the EtSB genome suggests that genome reduction is ongoing. Most strikingly, our genomic data convincingly show that the EtSB has lost photosynthetic ability and is metabolically dependent on its host cell, unprecedented characteristics among cyanobacteria, and cyanobacterial symbionts. The diatom-spheroid body endosymbiosis is thus a unique system for investigating the processes underlying the integration of a bacterial endosymbiont into eukaryotic cells. ",1,0,1,0,0

15492926,2004,"Members of the cytochrome P450 3A subfamily catalyze the metabolism of endogenous substrates, environmental carcinogens, and clinically important exogenous compounds, such as prescription drugs and therapeutic agents. In particular, the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes play an especially important role in pharmacogenetics, since they metabolize >50% of the drugs on the market. However, known genetic variants at these two loci are not sufficient to account for the observed phenotypic variability in drug response. We used a comparative genomics approach to identify conserved coding and noncoding regions at these genes and resequenced them in three ethnically diverse human populations. We show that remarkable interpopulation differences exist with regard to frequency spectrum and haplotype structure. The non-African samples are characterized by a marked excess of rare variants and the presence of a homogeneous group of long-range haplotypes at high frequency. The CYP3A5*1/*3 polymorphism, which is likely to influence salt and water retention and risk for salt-sensitive hypertension, was genotyped in >1,000 individuals from 52 worldwide population samples. The results reveal an unusual geographic pattern whereby the CYP3A5*3 frequency shows extreme variation across human populations and is significantly correlated with distance from the equator. Furthermore, we show that an unlinked variant, AGT M235T, previously implicated in hypertension and pre-eclampsia, exhibits a similar geographic distribution and is significantly correlated in frequency with CYP3A5*1/*3.

Anxiety disorders are a potentially disabling group of disorders that frequently co-occur with alcohol use disorders. Comorbid anxiety and alcohol use disorders are associated with poorer outcomes, and are difficult to treat with standard psychosocial interventions.

OBJECTIVE:
To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders, specifically: to provide an estimate of the overall effects of medication in improving treatment response and reducing symptom severity in the treatment of anxiety disorders in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders; to determine whether specific medications are more effective and tolerable than other medications in the treatment of particular anxiety disorders; and to identify which factors (clinical, methodological) predict response to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders.

All true RCTs of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety disorders with comorbid alcohol use disorders. Trials assessing drugs administered for the treatment of drinking behaviour, such as naltrexone, disulfiram and acomprosate were not eligible for inclusion in this systematic review.
METHODS:
A systematic review is a standardised evaluation of all research studies that address a particular clinical issue.Two review authors independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data and assessed trial quality. We contacted investigators to obtain missing data. We calculated categorical and continuous treatment effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for treatment using a random-effects model with effect-size variability expressed using Chi(2) and I(2) heterogeneity statistics.
RESULTS:
We included five placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy RCTs (with 290 participants) in the review. Most of the trials provided little information on how randomization was performed or on whether both participants and study personnel were blinded to the intervention. Two of the three trials reporting superiority of medication compared with placebo on anxiety symptom outcomes were industry funded. We regarded one trial as being at high risk of bias due to selective reporting.Study participants had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) III- and DSM IV-diagnosed alcohol use disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (two studies), social anxiety disorder (SAD; two studies) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; one study). Four trials assessed the efficacy of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs: sertraline, paroxetine); one RCT investigated the efficacy of buspirone, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) partial agonist. Treatment duration lasted between eight and 24 weeks. Overall, 70% of participants included in the review were male.There was very low quality evidence for an effect of paroxetine on global clinical response to treatment, as assessed by the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement scale (CGI-I). Global clinical response was observed in more than twice as many participants with paroxetine than with placebo (57.7% with paroxetine versus 25.8% with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 2.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.41; 2 trials, 57 participants). However, there was substantial uncertainty regarding the size of the effect of paroxetine due to the small number of studies providing data on clinically diverse patient samples. The second primary outcome measure was reduction of anxiety symptom severity. Although study investigators reported that buspirone (one trial) was superior to placebo in reducing the severity of anxiety symptoms over 12 weeks, no evidence of efficacy was observed for paroxetine (mean difference (MD) -14.70, 95% CI -33.00 to 3.60, 2 trials, 44 participants) and sertraline (one trial). Paroxetine appeared to be equally effective in reducing the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine in one RCT. The maximal reduction in anxiety disorder symptom severity was achieved after six weeks with paroxetine (two RCTs) and 12 weeks with buspirone (one RCT), with maintenance of medication efficacy extending to 16 with paroxetine and 24 weeks with buspirone. There was no evidence of an effect for any of the medications tested on abstinence from alcohol use or depression symptoms. There was very low quality evidence that paroxetine was well tolerated, based on drop-out due to treatment-emergent adverse effects. Nevertheless, levels of treatment discontinuation were high, with 43.1% of the participants in the studies withdrawing from medication treatment. Certain adverse effects, such as sexual problems, were commonly reported after treatment with paroxetine and sertraline.
CONCLUSIONS:
The evidence-base for the effectiveness of medication in treating anxiety disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorders is currently inconclusive. There was a small amount of evidence for the efficacy of medication, but this was limited and of very low quality. The majority of the data for the efficacy and tolerability of medication were for SSRIs; there were insufficient data to establish differences in treatment efficacy between medication classes or patient subgroups. There was a small amount of very low quality evidence that medication was well tolerated. There was no evidence that alcohol use was responsive to medication.Large, rigorously conducted RCTs would help supplement the small evidence-base for the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for anxiety and comorbid alcohol use disorders. Further research on patient subgroups who may benefit from pharmacological treatment, as well as novel pharmacological interventions, is warranted.

27632564,2016,"Hypersaline environments that are subject to salinity changes are particularly rich in viruses. Here we report a newly isolated archaeal halovirus, Haloarcula hispanica pleomorphic virus 3 (HHPV3). Its reproduction significantly retards host growth and decreases cell viability without causing lysis. HHPV3 particles require a minimum of 3M NaCl for stability and maintain high infectivity even in saturated salt. Notably, virions are irreversibly inactivated at ~1.5M NaCl in neutral pH, but tolerate this salinity at alkaline pH. The HHPV3 virion is a pleomorphic membrane vesicle containing two major protein species and lipids acquired nonselectively from the host membrane. The circular double-stranded DNA genome contains a conserved gene block characteristic of pleolipoviruses. We propose that HHPV3 is a member of the Betapleolipovirus genus (family Pleolipoviridae). Our findings add insights into the diversity observed among the pleolipoviruses found in hypersaline environments.",1,0,1,0,0
30909907,2019,"BACKGROUND:
In England, influenza and pertussis vaccination has been recommended for all pregnant women since 2010 and 2012 respectively. However, in some areas, vaccination uptake rates have been low. A qualitative study was conducted to gain a contextualised understanding of factors influencing vaccination acceptance during pregnancy in Hackney, a borough in north-east London, UK. This paper draws on in-depth insights gained from the above study, to provide recommendations for increasing long-term maternal vaccination acceptance.
METHODS:
Hackney was chosen as the study site because it has one of the lowest vaccination coverage rates in pregnancy in the UK. A maximum variation sampling method was used to recruit 47 pregnant and recently pregnant women from a wide range of backgrounds, as well as ten healthcare professionals from three general practices; two community antenatal clinics; nine parent-toddler groups; and four community centres. In-depth interviews and a video-recording of a pregnant patient's consultation, explored experiences of care within the National Health Service during pregnancy, and women's views about maternal vaccination. In-depth interviews with healthcare professionals explored their views towards, and how they discuss and provide maternal vaccination. Study data were analysed both deductively, through drawing on insights from anthropological works that address diverse conceptualisations and practices around vaccination; and inductively, with a thematic analysis approach.
RESULTS:
The findings of this study and the recommendations based on them were divided into five broad themes: access to maternal vaccination; healthcare institution rhetoric and its effect on maternal vaccination acceptance; community and family influences on maternal vaccination decisions; healthcare professionals' views towards maternal vaccination; and the influence of patient-healthcare professional relationships on maternal vaccination acceptance.
CONCLUSIONS:
The strategies to improve maternal vaccination acceptance recommended in this paper would engender a more open and democratised healthcare system.

28764682,2017,"BACKGROUND:
Pictorial warning labels (PWLs) deter initiation and motivate quitting. Assessing PWLs is important to track effectiveness and wear out. Jordan introduced an updated set of PWLs in 2013. This study assessed the effectiveness of the set after 2.5 years on the market.
METHODS:
We administered a survey in a cross-sectional sample of young adults aged 17-26 years. For convenience, respondents were recruited on university campuses. For heterogeneity, respondents were solicited from the different schools in four geographically diverse university campuses. The study compared perceptions of effectiveness surveyed in 2015 to perceptions gauged in 2010 during a pre-launch evaluation exercise. Outcomes of interest were: salience, fear evocation, adding information, and ability to motivate quitting smoking (for smokers) or deterring starting (for non-smokers).
RESULTS:
Results indicate awareness of the set among smokers and non-smokers, and their recall of at least one PWL message. Results also indicate effectiveness of the set: (1) 1/3 smokers who frequently saw them reported PWLs to trigger considering quitting, (2) and among both smokers and non-smokers the set in 2015 sustained ability to motivate quitting and staying smoke-free. However, results uncover erosion of salience, suggesting that the set has reached its end of life. Finally, results reveal variability in performance among PWLs; the one PWL that depicts human suffering significantly outperformed the others, and its ability to motivate was most strongly associated with its ability to evoke fear.
CONCLUSION:
Based on the early signs of wear-out (i.e. erosion of salience), and understanding the importance of sustaining upstream outcomes (especially fear evocation) to sustain motivation, we recommend retiring this set of PWLs and replacing it with a stronger set in line with proven standards.

26742640,2015,"Fe65 is a brain enriched multi domain adaptor protein involved in diverse cellular functions. One of its binding partners is the amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP), which after sequential proteolytic processing by secretases gives rise to the Alzheimer's Aβ peptide. Fe65 binds to the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Several studies have indicated that Fe65 binding promotes the amyloidogenic processing of APP. It has previously been shown that expression of APP increases concomitantly with a shift of its processing to the non-amyloidogenic pathway during neuronal differentiation. In this study we wanted to investigate the effects of neuronal differentiation on Fe65 expression. We observed that differentiation of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells induced by retinoic acid (RA), the phorbol ester PMA, or the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT resulted in an electrophoretic mobility shift of Fe65. Similar effects were observed in rat PC6.3 cells treated with nerve growth factor. The electrophoretic mobility shift was shown to be due to phosphorylation. Previous studies have shown that Fe65 phosphorylation can prevent the APP-Fe65 interaction. We propose that phosphorylation is a way to modify the functions of Fe65 and to promote the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP during neuronal differentiation. ",1,0,1,0,0

Case report.
OBJECTIVE:
To report on a case of traumatic pneumorachis in a child and to review the existing literature.
BACKGROUND:
Pneumorachis, the presence of air in the spinal canal, is an extremely rare finding. It may be caused by diverse pathologies such as incidental durotomy, barotrauma, pneumothorax, and trauma. In the polytrauma patient, it may be an indication of an occult spinal fracture.
METHODS:
The case of a 15-year old with complete paraplegia presenting with pneumorachis is presented.
RESULTS:
The initial computed tomography scan showed air in the spinal canal as well as surrounding subpleural and intramuscular spaces. However, there was near normal vertebral alignment with no fractures seen. Magnetic resonance imaging taken after the patient was stabilized showed a complete transaction of the spine at T3-T4 with ligamentous injury. A posterior instrumentation and fusion was performed.
CONCLUSIONS:
In the pediatric patient presenting with neurologic deficits and pneumorachis, ligamentous injury of the spine, even in the absence of bony injury, should be suspected.

18955158,2008,"In aerobic organisms, oxygen is essential for efficient energy production but paradoxically, produces chronic toxic stress in cells. Diverse protective systems must exist to enable adaptation to oxidative environments. Oxidative stress (OS) results when production of reactive oxidative species (ROS) exceeds the capacity of cellular antioxidant defenses to remove these toxic species. Epidemiological and clinical studies have linked environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle to cancer, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative disorders. All of these conditions, as well as the aging process, are associated with OS due to elevation of ROS or insufficient ROS detoxification. Many environmental pollutants engage signaling pathways that are activated in response to OS. The same sequences of events are also associated with the etiology and early pathology of many chronic diseases. Investigations of oxidative responses in different in vivo models suggest that, in complex organisms such as mammals, organs and tissues contain distinct antioxidant systems, and this may form the basis for differential susceptibility to environmental toxic agents Thus, understanding the pathways leading to the induction of antioxidant responses will enable development of strategies to protect against oxidative damage.

28029651,2017,"Pseudogenes have been considered as non-functional transcriptional relics of human genomic for long time. However, recent studies revealed that they play a plethora of roles in diverse physiological and pathological processes, especially in cancer, and many pseudogenes are transcribed into long noncoding RNAs and emerging as a novel class of lncRNAs. However, the biological roles and underlying mechanism of pseudogenes in the pathogenesis of non small cell lung cancer are still incompletely elucidated. This study identifies a putative oncogenic pseudogene DUXAP10 in NSCLC, which is located in 14q11.2 and 2398 nt in length. Firstly, we found that DUXAP10 was significantly up-regulated in 93 human NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and increased DUXAP10 was associated with patients poorer prognosis and short survival time. Furthermore, the loss and gain of functional studies including growth curves, migration, invasion assays and in vivo studies verify the oncogenic roles of DUXAP10 in NSCLC. Finally, the mechanistic experiments indicate that DUXAP10 could interact with Histone demethylase Lysine specific demethylase1 (LSD1) and repress tumor suppressors Large tumor suppressor 2 (LATS2) and Ras-related associated with diabetes (RRAD) transcription in NSCLC cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate DUXAP10 exerts the oncogenic roles through binding with LSD1 and epigenetic silencing LATS2 and RRAD expression. Our investigation reveals the novel roles of pseudogene in NSCLC, which may serve as new target for NSCLC diagnosis and therapy.",1,0,1,0,0
23383127,2013,"Facile laboratory tools are needed to augment identification in contamination events to trace the contamination back to the source (traceback) of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis). Understanding the evolution and diversity within and among outbreak strains is the first step towards this goal. To this end, we collected 106 new S. Enteriditis isolates within S. Enteriditis Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern JEGX01.0004 and close relatives, and determined their genome sequences. Sources for these isolates spanned food, clinical and environmental farm sources collected during the 2010 S. Enteritidis shell egg outbreak in the United States along with closely related serovars, S. Dublin, S. Gallinarum biovar Pullorum and S. Gallinarum. Despite the highly homogeneous structure of this population, S. Enteritidis isolates examined in this study revealed thousands of SNP differences and numerous variable genes (n = 366). Twenty-one of these genes from the lineages leading to outbreak-associated samples had nonsynonymous (causing amino acid changes) changes and five genes are putatively involved in known Salmonella virulence pathways. While chromosome synteny and genome organization appeared to be stable among these isolates, genome size differences were observed due to variation in the presence or absence of several phages and plasmids, including phage RE-2010, phage P125109, plasmid pSEEE3072_19 (similar to pSENV), plasmid pOU1114 and two newly observed mobile plasmid elements pSEEE1729_15 and pSEEE0956_35. These differences produced modifications to the assembled bases for these draft genomes in the size range of approximately 4.6 to 4.8 mbp, with S. Dublin being larger (∼4.9 mbp) and S. Gallinarum smaller (4.55 mbp) when compared to S. Enteritidis. Finally, we identified variable S.

23359638,2013,"In an era when global biodiversity is increasingly impacted by rapidly changing climate, efforts to conserve global biodiversity may be compromised if we do not consider the uneven distribution of climate-induced threats. Here, via a novel application of an aggregate Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI) that combines changes in mean annual temperature and precipitation with changes in their interannual variability, we assess multi-dimensional climate changes across the ""Global 200"" ecoregions - a set of priority ecoregions designed to ""achieve the goal of saving a broad diversity of the Earth's ecosystems"" - over the 21(st) century. Using an ensemble of 62 climate scenarios, our analyses show that, between 1991-2010 and 2081-2100, 96% of the ecoregions considered will be likely (more than 66% probability) to face moderate-to-pronounced climate changes, when compared to the magnitudes of change during the past five decades. Ecoregions at high northern latitudes are projected to experience most pronounced climate change, followed by those in the Mediterranean Basin, Amazon Basin, East Africa, and South Asia. Relatively modest RCCI signals are expected over ecoregions in Northwest South America, West Africa, and Southeast Asia, yet with considerable uncertainties. Although not indicative of climate-change impacts per se, the RCCI-based assessment can help policy-makers gain a quantitative and comprehensive overview of the unevenly distributed climate risks across the G200 ecoregions. Whether due to significant climate change signals or large uncertainties, the ecoregions highlighted in the assessment deserve special attention in more detailed impact assessments to inform effective conservation strategies under future climate change.",1,0,1,0,12

As for the black-legged tick, I. scapularis Say, global warming may also favor northward expansion of other species of medically important ticks. The aims of this study were to determine (1) current diversity and abundance of ticks of public health significance other than I. scapularis, (2) sex and age of the human population bitten by these ticks (3), and the seasonal and geographic pattern of their occurrence. From 2007 to 2015, twelve tick species other than I. scapularis were submitted in the Québec passive tick surveillance program. Of these 9243 ticks, 91.2% were Ixodes cookei, 4.1% were Dermacentor variabilis, 4.0% were Rhipicephalus sanguineus and 0.7% were Amblyomma americanum. The combined annual proportion of submitted I. cookei, D. variabilis, R. sanguineus and A. americanum ticks in passive surveillance rose from 6.1% in 2007 to 16.0% in 2015 and an annual growing trend was observed for each tick species. The number of municipalities where I. cookei ticks were acquired rose from 104 to 197 during the same period.

28353616,2017,"BACKGROUND:
Recently, several studies showed that the polymorphisms in the coagulation-related genes might be associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE); however, the results were still controversial. We performed a meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis to investigate the associations between the endothelial cell-activated protein C receptor (EPCR) rs9574, F11 rs2289252, F11 rs2036914, FGG rs2066865, FGG rs1049636, CYP4V2 rs13146272, SERPINC1 rs2227589, and GP6 rs1613662 polymorphisms with the risk of VTE.
METHODS:
We searched both the common English-language databases and the Chinese literature databases. Two authors selected studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Crude odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the strength of this association. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with the chi-square-based Q test and the I statistic.
RESULTS:
Overall, a total of 20 studies were included. The meta-analysis revealed that the F11 rs2289252, F11 rs2036914, FGG rs2066865, and CYP4V2 rs13146272 polymorphisms were closely related to the development of VTE in the white race under the best genetic models after multiple testing adjustments. The EPCR rs9574, FGG rs1049636, SERPINC1 rs2227589, and GP6 rs1613662 polymorphisms might be potential candidates in the pathogenesis of VTE, but trial sequential analyses and sensitivity analyses indicated that the evidences were limited.

Finally, our study demonstrated the important role of rs2289252, rs2036914, rs2066865, and rs13146272 polymorphisms in the development of VTE in the white race. Rs9574, rs1049636, rs2227589 and rs1613662 polymorphisms might be risk factors of VTE.

23937438,2013,"A new paradigm for the pathogenesis of female pelvic cancer helps explain persistent problems in describing the development and diverse morphology of these neoplasms. This paradigm incorporates recent advances in the molecular pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) with new insights into the origin of these tumors. Correlated clinicopathologic and molecular genetic studies gave rise to a dualistic model that divides the various histologic types of EOCs into two broad categories designated type I and type II. Because serous carcinomas are the most common EOC and account for the vast majority of deaths, they form the subject of this review. Recent studies indicate that the precursor of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma appears to develop from an occult intraepithelial carcinoma in the fimbria of the fallopian tube and involves the ovary secondarily. Another possible mechanism is implantation of normal fimbrial epithelium on the denuded ovarian surface at the site of rupture when ovulation occurs, causing the development of cortical inclusion cysts. The dualistic model serves as a framework for the study of ovarian cancer and can help investigators organize this complex group of neoplasms. It also facilitates the development of novel approaches to prevention, screening, and treatment of this devastating disease. ",1,1,2,0,0

The diversity of genes encoding bacterial demethylation (dmdA) and DMS production (dddL and dddP) were measured in Arctic Kongsfjorden. Both dmdA and dddL genes were detected in all stations along a transect from the outer to the inner fjord, while dddP gene was only found in the outer and middle parts of the fjord. The dmdA gene was completely confined to the Roseobacter clade, while the dddL gene was confined to the genus Sulfitobacter. Although the dddP gene pool was also dominated by homologs from the Roseobacter clade, there were a few dddP genes showing close relationships to both Alphaproteobacter and Gammaproteobacter.

16598261,2006,"Telomere replication is achieved through the combined action of the conventional DNA replication machinery and the reverse transcriptase, telomerase. Telomere-binding proteins have crucial roles in controlling telomerase activity; however, little is known about their role in controlling semi-conservative replication, which synthesizes the bulk of telomeric DNA. Telomere repeats in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are bound by Taz1, a regulator of diverse telomere functions. It is generally assumed that telomere-binding proteins impede replication fork progression. Here we show that, on the contrary, Taz1 is crucial for efficient replication fork progression through the telomere. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we find that loss of Taz1 leads to stalled replication forks at telomeres and internally placed telomere sequences, regardless of whether the telomeric G-rich strand is replicated by leading- or lagging-strand synthesis. In contrast, the Taz1-interacting protein Rap1 is dispensable for efficient telomeric fork progression. Upon loss of telomerase, taz1Delta telomeres are lost precipitously, suggesting that maintenance of taz1Delta telomere repeats cannot be sustained through semi-conservative replication. As the human telomere proteins TRF1 and TRF2 are Taz1 orthologues, we predict that one or both of the human TRFs may orchestrate fork passage through human telomeres. Stalled forks at dysfunctional human telomeres are likely to accelerate the genomic instability that drives tumorigenesis.",1,0,1,0,0
20150279,2010,"The differentiated features of postmitotic neurons are dictated by the expression of specific transcription factors. The mechanisms by which the precise spatiotemporal expression patterns of these factors are regulated are poorly understood. In C. elegans, the ceh-36 Otx homeobox gene is expressed in the AWC sensory neurons throughout postembryonic development, and regulates terminal differentiation of this neuronal subtype. Here, we show that the HMX/NKX homeodomain protein MLS-2 regulates ceh-36 expression specifically in the AWC neurons. Consequently, the AWC neurons fail to express neuron type-specific characteristics in mls-2 mutants. mls-2 is expressed transiently in postmitotic AWC neurons, and directly initiates ceh-36 expression. CEH-36 subsequently interacts with a distinct site in its cis-regulatory sequences to maintain its own expression, and also directly regulates the expression of AWC-specific terminal differentiation genes. We also show that MLS-2 acts in additional neuron types to regulate their development and differentiation. Our analysis describes a transcription factor cascade that defines the unique postmitotic characteristics of a sensory neuron subtype, and provides insights into the spatiotemporal regulatory mechanisms that generate functional diversity in the sensory nervous system.",1,0,1,0,0

27481242,2016,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the nasopharynx. Herein we show that carbon availability is distinct between the nasopharynx and bloodstream of adult humans: glucose is absent from the nasopharynx, whereas galactose is abundant. We demonstrate that pneumococcal neuraminidase A (NanA), which cleaves terminal sialic acid residues from host glycoproteins, exposed galactose on the surface of septal epithelial cells, thereby increasing its availability during colonization. We observed that S. pneumoniae mutants deficient in NanA and β-galactosidase A (BgaA) failed to form biofilms in vivo despite normal biofilm-forming abilities in vitro Subsequently, we observed that glucose, sucrose, and fructose were inhibitory for biofilm formation, whereas galactose, lactose, and low concentrations of sialic acid were permissive. Together these findings suggested that the genes involved in biofilm formation were under some form of carbon catabolite repression (CCR), a regulatory network in which genes involved in the uptake and metabolism of less-preferred sugars are silenced during growth with preferred sugars. Supporting this notion, we observed that a mutant deficient in pyruvate oxidase, which converts pyruvate to acetyl-phosphate under non-CCR-inducing growth conditions, was unable to form biofilms. Subsequent comparative transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of planktonic and biofilm-grown pneumococci showed that metabolic pathways involving the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-phosphate and subsequently leading to fatty acid biosynthesis were consistently upregulated during diverse biofilm growth conditions. We conclude that carbon availability in the nasopharynx impacts pneumococcal biofilm formation in vivo Additionally, biofilm formation involves metabolic pathways not previously appreciated to play an important role.",1,1,2,0,0
24189143,2013,"Globally, an estimated 13 million preterm babies are born each year. These babies are at increased risk of infant mortality and life-long health complications. Interventions to prevent preterm birth (PTB) require an understanding of processes driving parturition. Prostaglandins (PGs) have diverse functions in parturition, including regulation of uterine contractility and tissue remodeling. Our studies on cervical remodeling in mice suggest that although local synthesis of PGs are not increased in term ripening, transcripts encoding PG-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2) are induced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated premature ripening. This study provides evidence for two distinct pathways of cervical ripening: one dependent on PGs derived from paracrine or endocrine sources and the other independent of PG actions. Cervical PG levels are increased in LPS-treated mice, a model of infection-mediated PTB, consistent with increases in PG synthesizing enzymes and reduction in PG-metabolizing enzymes. Administration of SC-236, a PTGS2 inhibitor, along with LPS attenuated cervical softening, consistent with the essential role of PGs in LPS-induced ripening. In contrast, during term and preterm ripening mediated by the antiprogestin, mifepristone, cervical PG levels, and expression of PG synthetic and catabolic enzymes did not change in a manner that supports a role for PGs. These findings in mice, supported by correlative studies in women, suggest PGs do not regulate all aspects of the parturition process. Additionally, it suggests a need to refocus current strategies toward developing therapies for the prevention of PTB that target early, pathway-specific processes rather than focusing on common late end point mediators of PTB.

Because trial participants usually harbour multi-clonal P. falciparum infections, deep amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) was employed to improve sensitivity and reliability of minority clone detection. Paired samples from 32 drug trial participants were Illumina deep-sequenced for five molecular markers. Reads were analysed by custom-made software HaplotypR and trial outcomes compared to results from the previous standard genotyping method based on length-polymorphic markers. Diversity of AmpSeq markers in pre-treatment samples was comparable or higher than length-polymorphic markers. AmpSeq was highly reproducible with consistent quantification of co-infecting parasite clones within a host. Outcomes of the three best-performing markers, cpmp, cpp and ama1-D3, agreed in 26/32 (81%) of patients. Discordance between the three markers performed per sample was much lower by AmpSeq (six patients) compared to length-polymorphic markers (eleven patients). Using AmpSeq for discrimination of recrudescence and new infection in antimalarial drug trials provides highly reproducible and robust characterization of clone dynamics during trial follow-up. AmpSeq overcomes limitations inherent to length-polymorphic markers. Regulatory clinical trials of antimalarial drugs will greatly benefit from this unbiased typing method.",1,1,2,0,0
25211471,2014,"It has long been known that methylated cytosines deaminate at higher rates than unmodified cytosines and constitute mutational hotspots in mammalian genomes. The repertoire of naturally occurring cytosine modifications, however, extends beyond 5-methylcytosine to include its oxidation derivatives, notably 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The effects of these modifications on sequence evolution are unknown. Here, we combine base-resolution maps of methyl- and hydroxymethylcytosine in human and mouse with population genomic, divergence and somatic mutation data to show that hydroxymethylated and methylated cytosines show distinct patterns of variation and evolution. Surprisingly, hydroxymethylated sites are consistently associated with elevated C to G transversion rates at the level of segregating polymorphisms, fixed substitutions, and somatic mutations in tumors. Controlling for multiple potential confounders, we find derived C to G SNPs to be 1.43-fold (1.22-fold) more common at hydroxymethylated sites compared to methylated sites in human (mouse). Increased C to G rates are evident across diverse functional and sequence contexts and, in cancer genomes, correlate with the expression of Tet enzymes and specific components of the mismatch repair pathway (MSH2, MSH6, and MBD4). Based on these and other observations we suggest that hydroxymethylation is associated with a distinct mutational burden and that the mismatch repair pathway is implicated in causing elevated transversion rates at hydroxymethylated cytosines.

22880020,2012,"Phlebotomine sand flies are vectors of Leishmania that are acquired by the female sand fly during blood feeding on an infected mammal. Leishmania parasites develop exclusively in the gut lumen during their residence in the insect before transmission to a suitable host during the next blood feed. Female phlebotomine sand flies are blood feeding insects but their life style of visiting plants as well as animals, and the propensity for larvae to feed on detritus including animal faeces means that the insect host and parasite are exposed to a range of microorganisms. Thus, the sand fly microbiota may interact with the developing Leishmania population in the gut. The aim of the study was to investigate and identify the bacterial diversity associated with wild adult female Lutzomyia sand flies from different geographical locations in the New World. The bacterial phylotypes recovered from 16S rRNA gene clone libraries obtained from wild caught adult female Lutzomyia sand flies were estimated from direct band sequencing after denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of bacterial 16 rRNA gene fragments. These results confirm that the Lutzomyia sand flies contain a limited array of bacterial phylotypes across several divisions. Several potential plant-related bacterial sequences were detected including Erwinia sp. and putative Ralstonia sp. from two sand fly species sampled from 3 geographically separated regions in Brazil. Identification of putative human pathogens also demonstrated the potential for sand flies to act as vectors of bacterial pathogens of medical importance in addition to their role in Leishmania transmission.",1,1,7,0,1
21920269,2011,"OBJECTIVE:
The purpose of this study was to determine the association of family history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with PAD prevalence and severity.
BACKGROUND:
PAD is a significant public health problem. Shared genetic and environmental factors may play an important role in the development of PAD. However, family history of PAD has not been investigated adequately.
METHODS:
The San Diego Population Study enrolled 2,404 ethnically diverse men and women 29 to 91 years of age who attended a baseline visit from 1994 through 1998 to assess PAD and venous disease. Ankle brachial index measurement was performed at the baseline clinic examination, and family history of PAD was obtained via questionnaire. Family history of PAD was defined primarily as having any first-degree relative with PAD. Prevalent PAD was defined as ankle brachial index ≤ 0.90, and severe prevalent PAD was defined as ankle brachial index ≤ 0.70, with both definitions also including any previous leg revascularization. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of family history of PAD with prevalent PAD.
RESULTS:
The mean age was 59 ± 11 years, 66% were women, and 58% were Caucasian, with 42% representing other racial or ethnic groups. Prevalence of PAD was 3.6%, and severe prevalent PAD was 1.9%. In fully adjusted models, family history of PAD was associated with a 1.83-fold higher odds of PAD (95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 3.26, p = 0.04), an association that was stronger for severe prevalent PAD (odds ratio: 2.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.13 to 5.23, p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS:
Family history of PAD is independently strongly associated with PAD prevalence and severity. This indicates a role for genetic factors or other shared environmental factors, or both, contributing to PAD.

The Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI) Early Alerting and Reporting (EAR) project was launched to assess the feasibility and opportunity for pooling epidemic intelligence data from seven expert systems. EAR participants completed a qualitative survey to document epidemic intelligence strategies and to assess perceptions regarding the systems performance. Timeliness and sensitivity were rated highly illustrating the value of the systems for epidemic intelligence. Weaknesses identified included representativeness, completeness and flexibility. These findings were corroborated by the quantitative analysis performed on signals potentially related to influenza A/H5N1 events occurring in March 2010. For the six systems for which this information was available, the detection rate ranged from 31% to 38%, and increased to 72% when considering the virtual combined system. The effective positive predictive values ranged from 3% to 24% and F1-scores ranged from 6% to 27%. System sensitivity ranged from 38% to 72%. An average difference of 23% was observed between the sensitivities calculated for human cases and epizootics, underlining the difficulties in developing an efficient algorithm for a single pathology. However, the sensitivity increased to 93% when the virtual combined system was considered, clearly illustrating complementarities between individual systems. The average delay between the detection of A/H5N1 events by the systems and their official reporting by WHO or OIE was 10.2 days (95% CI: 6.7-13.8). This work illustrates the diversity in implemented epidemic intelligence activities, differences in system's designs, and the potential added values and opportunities for synergy between systems, between users and between systems and users.",1,0,1,0,0
29618333,2018,"BACKGROUND:
The Kallikrein-Kinin System (KKS) has been found to play a role in tumor progression in several cancers. The KKS metabolic cascade depends on signalling through two cross talking receptors; bradykinin receptor 1 (B1R) and bradykinin receptor 2 (B2R). Activation of the Kinin receptor is responsible for multiple pathophysiologic functions including increase of vascular permeability and induction of host inflammatory responses that exert diverse effects on tumor growth.
METHODS:
B1R and B2R expression on mouse and human CRC cell lines was investigated. Changes in tumor growth and progression was assessed in male CBA mice bearing colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) following treatment with B1R or B2R blockers. In vitro cultures of human SW-480 and mouse colorectal cancer (MoCR) cell lines were examined for changes in their proliferation and migration properties following treatment with B1R or B2R blockers.
RESULTS:
Both colorectal cancer cell lines tested strongly positive for B1R and B2R expression. Inhibition of both receptors retarded tumor growth but only B1R blockade significantly reduced tumor load and increased tumor apoptosis. Blockade of either receptor reduced tumor vascularization in vivo and significantly inhibited proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells in vitro.
CONCLUSION:
Taken together, the present study demonstrated that kinin receptor blockade inhibited tumor growth and reduced its invading properties suggesting that KKS manipulation could be a novel target in colorectal cancer therapy.

7760718,1995,"To explore further the varied clinical expression of anti-Ro(SS-A) antibody positive patients and to determine the outcomes of these patients, we followed 100 anti-Ro(SS-A) antibody positive patients, originally seen at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in 1982 and 1983, over a 10-year period. The results of this study indicate that anti-Ro(SS-A) antibody positive patients have a diverse clinical presentation and that the anti-Ro(SS-A) antibody response generally persists for years. Some of these patients appear to have a static disease process for years. However, 65% (51, including 13 deaths, of 78 patients) of the patients for whom we had follow-up data had a chronic (10 years or greater) progressive disease process. Black patients, in general, have an earlier onset of disease and may have a more severe disease than white patients. At least 25% of our anti-Ro(SS-A) antibody positive patients demonstrated a dynamic change in clinical presentation with the development of Sjögren syndrome and/or a progressive ""rheumatoid-like"" arthritis. Interstitial pulmonary disease, central nervous system disease, and vasculitic insults occur frequently in these patients. Renal disease occurred in 19 anti-Ro(SS-A) positive patients, and in 47% of these renal disease patients, no anti-DNA antibodies (dsDNA or ssDNA) were detected. Cutaneous manifestations are prominent in anti-Ro(SS-A) antibody positive patients with lupus. Photosensitivity and a malar dermatitis were the most common features. Twenty percent of lupus patients had discoid lesions, and 20% had SCLE lesions. Based on this study, we believe that anti-Ro(SS-A) antibody positive patients should be routinely evaluated for the emergence of systemic features. Since these systemic features are at least in part, if not solely, the result of inflammation, early treatment with steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents may minimize the damage and influence in a positive manner the significant morbidity and mortality observed in some anti-Ro(SS-A) antibody positive patients.",1,0,1,2,2
32492069,2020,"PURPOSE:
To assess the one-year effectiveness and safety of ranibizumab 0.5 mg in treatment- naïve patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) enrolled in the real-world LUMINOUS study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS:
A 5-year, prospective, observational, open-label, global study which recruited 30,138 patients across all approved indications. Consenting patients (≥18 years) who were treatment-naïve or previously treated with ranibizumab or other ocular treatments were treated as per the local ranibizumab label. Here, we present the change in visual acuity (VA) (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letter score; primary treated eye) at Year 1, as well as the change in VA based on injection frequencies (≤4 and ≥5), treatment exposure, and the overall adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) in treatment-naïve DME patients.
RESULTS:
Of the 4,710 DME patients enrolled in the study, 1,063 were treatment-naïve. At baseline, mean age was 64.5 years, 54.7% were male, and 69.2% were white. At 1 year, mean VA letter score improved by +3.5 (n = 502) from a baseline of 57.7 with a mean of 4.5 injections. Presented by injection frequencies ≤4 and ≥5, VA letter score gains were 0.5 (n = 264) and 6.9 (n = 238) from baseline letter scores of 56.6 and 59.0, respectively. Over 5 years, the incidence of ocular/non-ocular AEs and SAEs was 7.2%/10.1% and 0.3%/5.8%, respectively. No endophthalmitis cases were reported.
CONCLUSIONS:
The LUMINOUS study included patients with DME with more diverse baseline characteristics than those in randomized clinical trials. The 1-year data showed improvement in VA with low number of injections in treatment- naïve patients with DME. Greater VA gains were observed in patients who received ≥5 injections. No new safety findings were identified. LUMINOUS confirms the effectiveness and safety of ranibizumab for the treatment of patients with DME in a real-world clinical practice.

23985341,2013,"BACKGROUND:
The barber's pole worm, Haemonchus contortus, is one of the most economically important parasites of small ruminants worldwide. Although this parasite can be controlled using anthelmintic drugs, resistance against most drugs in common use has become a widespread problem. We provide a draft of the genome and the transcriptomes of all key developmental stages of H. contortus to support biological and biotechnological research areas of this and related parasites.
RESULTS:
The draft genome of H. contortus is 320 Mb in size and encodes 23,610 protein-coding genes. On a fundamental level, we elucidate transcriptional alterations taking place throughout the life cycle, characterize the parasite's gene silencing machinery, and explore molecules involved in development, reproduction, host-parasite interactions, immunity, and disease. The secretome of H. contortus is particularly rich in peptidases linked to blood-feeding activity and interactions with host tissues, and a diverse array of molecules is involved in complex immune responses. On an applied level, we predict drug targets and identify vaccine molecules.
CONCLUSIONS:
The draft genome and developmental transcriptome of H. contortus provide a major resource to the scientific community for a wide range of genomic, genetic, proteomic, metabolomic, evolutionary, biological, ecological, and epidemiological investigations, and a solid foundation for biotechnological outcomes, including new anthelmintics, vaccines and diagnostic tests. This first draft genome of any strongylid nematode paves the way for a rapid acceleration in our understanding of a wide range of socioeconomically important parasites of one of the largest nematode orders.

27519343,2016,"BACKGROUND:
Differential RNA-Seq (dRNA-Seq) is a recently developed method of performing primary transcriptome analyses that allows for the genome-wide mapping of transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and the identification of novel transcripts. Although the transcriptomes of diverse bacterial species have been characterized by dRNA-Seq, the transcriptome analysis of archaeal species is still rather limited. Therefore, we used dRNA-Seq to characterize the primary transcriptome of the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii.
RESULTS:
Three independent cultures of Hfx. volcanii grown under optimal conditions to the mid-exponential growth phase were used to determine the primary transcriptome and map the 5'-ends of the transcripts. In total, 4749 potential TSSs were detected. A position weight matrix (PWM) was derived for the promoter predictions, and the results showed that 64 % of the TSSs were preceded by stringent or relaxed basal promoters. Of the identified TSSs, 1851 belonged to protein-coding genes. Thus, fewer than half (46 %) of the 4040 protein-coding genes were expressed under optimal growth conditions. Seventy-two percent of all protein-coding transcripts were leaderless, which emphasized that this pathway is the major pathway for translation initiation in haloarchaea. A total of 2898 of the TSSs belonged to potential non-coding RNAs, which accounted for an unexpectedly high fraction (61 %) of all transcripts. Most of the non-coding TSSs had not been previously described (2792) and represented novel sequences (59 % of all TSSs). A large fraction of the potential novel non-coding transcripts were cis-antisense RNAs (1244 aTSSs). A strong negative correlation between the levels of antisense transcripts and cognate sense mRNAs was found, which suggested that the negative regulation of gene expression via antisense RNAs may play an important role in haloarchaea. The other types of novel non-coding transcripts corresponded to internal transcripts overlapping with mRNAs (1153 iTSSs) and intergenic small RNA (sRNA) candidates (395 TSSs).
CONCLUSION:
This study provides a comprehensive map of the primary transcriptome of Hfx. volcanii grown under optimal conditions. Fewer than half of all protein-coding genes have been transcribed under these conditions. Unexpectedly, more than half of the detected TSSs belonged to several classes of non-coding RNAs. Thus, RNA-based regulation appears to play a more important role in haloarchaea than previously anticipated.

Genetic testing for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) is available, but the rates of acceptance of testing or barriers to participation are not known.
OBJECTIVE:
To investigate rates and predictors of utilization of genetic testing for HNPCC.
METHODS:
Cohort study conducted between July 1996 and July 1998.
METHODS:
Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer family registry.
METHODS:
Adult male and female members (n = 208) of 4 extended HNPCC families contacted for a baseline telephone interview.
METHODS:
Family education and individual genetic counseling.
METHODS:
Participant acceptance of HNPCC test results.
RESULTS:
Of the 208 family members, 90 (43%) received test results and 118 (57%) declined. Of 139 subjects (67%) who completed a baseline telephone interview, 84 (60%) received test results and 55 (40%) declined. Of the 84 subjects who received test results, 35 (42%) received information indicating that they had HNPCC-associated mutations and 49 (58%) that they did not. Test acceptors had higher education levels (odds ratio [OR], 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.49-5.61) and were more likely to have participated in a previous genetic linkage study (OR, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.84-10.10). The presence of depression symptoms significantly reduced rates of HNPCC test use (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.17-0.66). Although rates of test use were identical among men and women, the presence of depression symptoms resulted in a 4-fold decrease in test use among women (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.08-0.80) and a smaller, nonsignificant reduction among men (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.19-1.27).
CONCLUSIONS:
Despite having significantly elevated risks of developing colon cancer, a relatively small proportion of HNPCC family members are likely to use genetic testing. Barriers to test acceptance may include less formal education and the presence of depression symptoms, especially among women. Additional research is needed to generalize these findings to different clinical settings and racially diverse populations.

18254086,2008,"BACKGROUND:
Breast Care Nurses (BCNs) are now established internationally, predominantly in well resourced healthcare systems. The role of BCNs has expanded to reflect the diversity of the population in which they work, and the improvements in survival of women with breast cancer. Interventions by BCNs aim to support women and help them cope with the impact of the disease on their quality of life.
OBJECTIVE:
To assess the effectiveness of individual interventions carried out by BCN's on quality of life outcomes for women with breast cancer.
METHODS:
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (15 January 2007). We also searched MEDLINE (1966 to September 2006), CINAHL (1982 to September 2006), EMBASE (1980 to September 2006), British Nursing Index (1984 to September 2006), CancerLit (1961 to September 2006), PsycInfo (1967 to September 2006), Library and Info Science Abstracts (LISA) (1969 to September 2006), Dissertation Abstracts International (only available 2005 to September 2006). We contacted authors as appropriate.
METHODS:
Randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of interventions carried out by BCN's on quality of life outcomes, for women with breast cancer.
METHODS:
Two authors independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction and quality assessment of included studies.
RESULTS:
We incuded five studies, categorised into three groups. Three studies assessing psychosocial nursing interventions around diagnosis and early treatment found that the BCN could affect some components of quality of life, such as anxiety and early recognition of depressive symptoms. However, their impact on social and functional aspects of the disease trajectory was inconclusive. Supportive care interventions during radiotherapy was assessed by one study which showed that specific BCN interventions can alleviate perceived distress during radiotherapy treatment, but did not improve coping skills, mood or overall quality of life. One study assessed nurse-led follow-up interventions in which no statistically significant difference was identified for main demographic variables, satisfaction with care, access to medical care or anxiety and depression.
CONCLUSIONS:
There is limited evidence at this time to support the contention that interventions by BCNs assist in the short-term with the recognition and management of psychological distress for women with breast cancer. Further research is required before the impact of BCNs on aspects of quality of life for women with breast cancer can be known.

Thoracoscopy has become a favored modality in treating pediatric empyema. However, the factors affecting the outcome of thoracoscopic management remain unclear. In this study, we report our experience using thoracoscopy to treat empyema in pediatric patients and investigate the factors affecting outcome.
METHODS:
We retrospectively reviewed the demographic data, clinical presentation, radiographic findings, laboratory studies, and hospital course of 101 pediatric patients who underwent thoracoscopy for empyema between 1995 and 2008.
RESULTS:
Empyema was due to pneumococcus infection in 64 patients (63.4%), and 69% of the cultured microorganisms were penicillin nonsusceptible. Chest computed tomography scan was performed in 96 patients, in whom necrotizing pneumonia was noted in 35 (36.5%). Preoperative intensive care unit admission was required for 33 patients (32.7%). Preoperative chest tube drainage was performed in 36 patients (35.6%), and thoracoscopy was used as the primary treatment in the remaining 65 patients. Complications occurred in 10 patients (9.9%); there were no mortalities. The median postoperative hospital stay was 13 days. Multivariate analyses showed that necrotizing pneumonia was significantly associated with the presence of complications, and that necrotizing pneumonia, preoperative intensive care unit admission, and preoperative chest tube drainage were independent risk factors for a longer postoperative hospital stay.
CONCLUSIONS:
The clinical presentations of empyema in children requiring thoracoscopy are diverse. Patients with necrotizing pneumonia and those requiring preoperative intensive care unit admission and undergoing preoperative chest tube drainage are at high risk for developing complications and requiring longer hospital stay after thoracoscopy.

To date, few questionnaires examining psychosocial influences of physical activity (PA) participation have been psychometrically tested among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) youth. An understanding of these influences may help explain the observed differences in PA among CALD youth. Therefore, this study examined the reliability and predictive validity of a brief self-report questionnaire examining potential psychological and social correlates of physical activity among a sample of Chinese-Australian youth.
METHODS:
Two Chinese-weekend cultural schools from eastern metropolitan Melbourne consented to participate in this study. In total, 505 students aged 11 to 16 years were eligible for inclusion in the present study, and of these, 106 students agreed to participate (21% response rate). Participants completed at 37-item self-report questionnaire examining perceived psychological and social influences on physical activity participation twice, with a test-retest interval of 7 days. Predictive validity, internal consistency and test-retest reliability were evaluated using exploratory factor analyses, Cronbach's α coefficient, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) respectively. Predictive validity was assessed by correlating responses against duration spent in self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).
RESULTS:
The exploratory factor analysis revealed a nine factor structure, with the majority of factors exhibiting high internal consistency (α ≥ 0.6). In addition, four of the nine factors had an ICC ≥ 0.6. Spearman rank-order correlations coefficients between the nine factors and self-reported minutes spent in MVPA ranged from -0.5 to 0.3 for all participants.
CONCLUSIONS:
This is the first study to examine the psychometric properties of a potential psychological and social correlates questionnaire among Chinese-Australian youth. The questionnaire was found to provide reliable estimates on a range of psychological and social influences on physical activity and evidence of predictive validity on a limited number of factors. More research is required to improve the reliability and validity of the questionnaire.

The fossil record suggests that recovery of global ecosystems has required millions or even tens of millions of years. Thus, intervention by humans, the very agents of the current environmental crisis, is required for any possibility of short-term recovery or maintenance of the biota. Many current recovery efforts have deficiencies, including insufficient information on the diversity and distribution of species, ecological processes, and magnitude and interaction of threats to biodiversity (pollution, overharvesting, climate change, disruption of biogeochemical cycles, introduced or invasive species, habitat loss and fragmentation through land use, disruption of community structure in habitats, and others). A much greater and more urgently applied investment to address these deficiencies is obviously warranted. Conservation and restoration in human-dominated ecosystems must strengthen connections between human activities, such as agricultural or harvesting practices, and relevant research generated in the biological, earth, and atmospheric sciences. Certain threats to biodiversity require intensive international cooperation and input from the scientific community to mitigate their harmful effects, including climate change and alteration of global biogeochemical cycles.

Sexual and reproductive rights include access to accurate and appropriate information in order to make informed decisions. In the current age of media globalization and Internet, adolescents are exposed to information about sexual health and sexuality from a myriad of sources. The objective of this study was to explore sources of information and adolescent learning about sexual health and sexuality in Santiago, Chile.
METHODS:
Data collection included four focus group discussions with a total of 24 adolescents 18-19 years old, 20 semi-structured interviews with adolescents 16-19 years old, and seven interviews with key informants working with adolescents. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis.
RESULTS:
The primary sources of sexual health and sexuality information were parents, teachers and friends, whilst secondary sources included health professionals for females and Internet for males. Information provided by the trusted sources of parents, teachers and health professionals tended to focus on biological aspects of sexuality, particularly pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Limited emphasis was placed on topics such as love, attraction, pleasure, relationships, abstinence and sexual violence. Information focused primarily on heterosexual relations and reproduction. Adolescents learnt about relationships and sexual acts through friends, partners and, for many males, pornography. Findings indicate a lack of available information on partner communication, setting personal limits, and contraception, including morally neutral and medically correct information about emergency contraception.
CONCLUSIONS:
This study highlights numerous gaps between adolescent information needs and information provided by parents, teachers and health professionals. The priority these trusted sources place on providing biological information overshadows learning about emotional and relational aspects of sexuality. This biological rationalization of adolescent sexual behaviour neglects the way gender inequality, peer-pressure, coercion, media eroticization and religion influence adolescent sexual decision-making. The heteronormativity of information excludes other sexual orientations and disregards the diverse spectrum of human sexual behaviours. Finally, the limited provision of practical information hinders development of skills necessary for ensuring safe, consensual and pleasurable sexual relations. Trusted adults are encouraged to engage adolescents in critical reflection on a broad range of sexuality topics, dispelling myths, and building knowledge and skills necessary to make informed decisions.

The developmental regulation of this process has been extensively investigated in mice, where the X chromosome of paternal origin (Xp) is silenced during early embryogenesis owing to imprinted expression of the regulatory RNA, Xist (X-inactive specific transcript). Paternal XCI is reversed in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst and random XCI subsequently occurs in epiblast cells. Here we show that other eutherian mammals have very different strategies for initiating XCI. In rabbits and humans, the Xist homologue is not subject to imprinting and XCI begins later than in mice. Furthermore, Xist is upregulated on both X chromosomes in a high proportion of rabbit and human embryo cells, even in the inner cell mass. In rabbits, this triggers XCI on both X chromosomes in some cells. In humans, chromosome-wide XCI has not initiated even by the blastocyst stage, despite the upregulation of XIST. The choice of which X chromosome will finally become inactive thus occurs downstream of Xist upregulation in both rabbits and humans, unlike in mice. Our study demonstrates the remarkable diversity in XCI regulation and highlights differences between mammals in their requirement for dosage compensation during early embryogenesis.",1,1,3,0,0
24896101,2014,"Recently, the development of biobanks linked to electronic medical records has presented new opportunities for genetic and epidemiological research. Studies based on these resources, however, present unique challenges, including the accurate assignment of individual-level population ancestry. In this work we examine the accuracy of administratively-assigned race in diverse populations by comparing assigned races to genetically-defined ancestry estimates. Using 220 ancestry informative markers, we generated principal components for patients in our dataset, which were used to cluster patients into groups based on genetic ancestry. Consistent with other studies, we find a strong overall agreement (Kappa  = 0.872) between genetic ancestry and assigned race, with higher rates of agreement for African-descent and European-descent assignments, and reduced agreement for Hispanic, East Asian-descent, and South Asian-descent assignments. These results suggest caution when selecting study samples of non-African and non-European backgrounds when administratively-assigned race from biobanks is used. ",1,1,5,7,12
16081120,2005,"Twelve lytic viruses (PgV) infecting the marine unicellular eukaryotic harmful algal bloom species Phaeocystis globosa were isolated from the southern North Sea in 2000-2001 and partially characterized. All PgV isolates shared common phenotypic features with other algal viruses belonging to the family Phycodnaviridae and could be categorized in four different groups. Two main groups (PgV Group I and II) were discriminated based on particle size (150 and 100 nm respectively), genome size (466 and 177 kb) and structural protein composition. The lytic cycle showed a latent period of 10 h for PgV Group I and latent periods of 12 h and 16 h for PgV Group IIA and IIB. Host specificity and temperature sensitivity finally defined a fourth group (PgV Group IIC). Our results imply that viral infection plays an important role not only in P. globosa dynamics but also in the diversity of both host and virus community.",1,0,1,0,2
26597082,2015,"Following the discovery of the first Eukarya in the deep subsurface, intense interest has developed to understand the diversity of eukaryotes living in these extreme environments. We identified that Platyhelminthes, Rotifera, Annelida and Arthropoda are thriving at 1.4 km depths in palaeometeoric fissure water up to 12,300 yr old in South African mines. Protozoa and Fungi have also been identified; however, they are present in low numbers. Characterization of the different species reveals that many are opportunistic organisms with an origin due to recharge from surface waters rather than soil leaching. This is the first known study to demonstrate the in situ distribution of biofilms on fissure rock faces using video documentation. Calculations suggest that food, not dissolved oxygen is the limiting factor for eukaryal population growth. The discovery of a group of Eukarya underground has important implications for the search for life on other planets in our solar system. ",1,1,2,0,1
1456341,1992,"OBJECTIVE:
Professional education in public health should equip graduates with adequate knowledge and skills to manage diverse and complex problems. How best to address this challenge is widely debated. We describe the Harvard School of Public Health's self-evaluation and development of a practice-oriented program.
METHODS:
As part of Harvard's schoolwide review of the master of public health (MPH), self-administered questionnaires were distributed to all MPH students, 1987 to 1989, and international and US alumni, 1979 to 1986. Extensive discussions were conducted with relevant student and faculty groups.
RESULTS:
Survey results provided a basis for educational policy and curricular changes that culminated in a revised MPH that targets key areas of public health practice. Examples from the Harvard experience are provided.
CONCLUSIONS:
Information derived from student and alumni surveys can be highly effective in the process of guiding curricular change at schools of public health. This should be coupled with a strategic approach to gain faculty support for proposed innovations. Ongoing monitoring and modification of the new curriculum is essential.

30562377,2018,"BACKGROUND:
Many adolescents with obesity do not meet recommendations for nutrition, physical and sedentary activities, and sleep habits, all of which can influence weight management.
OBJECTIVE:
To explore barriers and enablers that influenced the adoption of lifestyle behavior changes among adolescents receiving multidisciplinary clinical care for pediatric weight management.
METHODS:
In this multi-centre, qualitative description study, we used purposeful sampling to recruit 13-17 year olds (body mass index ≥85th percentile) enrolled in one of two pediatric weight management clinics in Edmonton and Ottawa, Canada. Adolescents participated in one-on-one, in-person, semi-structured interviews in English or French. Interviews lasted 30-60 minutes, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and managed using NVivo 11. Data were triangulated using transcripts, field notes, and memos and analyzed by two independent researchers using inductive, semantic thematic analysis.
RESULTS:
In total, 19 adolescents (12 Anglophone and 7 Francophone; 15.1±1.7 years old; 3.5±0.6 BMI z-score; n = 11 female; n = 13 Caucasian) participated. Adolescents reported diverse barriers to and enablers of healthy nutrition, physical and sedentary activities, and sleep habits, which we organized into the following themes: physiological mechanisms and physical health status, self-regulation for behavior change, controllability and competence beliefs, social relationships and interactions, and accessibility to and availability of opportunities for lifestyle enhancement. Across these themes and lifestyle areas, we identified three shared barriers and/or enablers, including the degree of controllability, the impact of mental health, and social pressures related to weight management.
CONCLUSIONS:
This research provides evidence that can be used to tailor interventions and health services delivery, including a focus on psychosocial well-being, to support adolescents with obesity in making and maintaining healthy lifestyle behavior changes.

19546190,2009,"The gram-negative gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is equipped with an extraordinarily large set of outer membrane proteins (OMPs), whose role in the infection process is not well understood. The Hop (Helicobacter outer membrane porins) and Hor (Hop-related proteins) groups constitute a large paralogous family consisting of 33 members. The OMPs AlpA, AlpB, BabA, SabA, and HopZ have been identified as adhesins or adherence-associated proteins. To better understand the relevance of these and other OMPs during infection, we analyzed the expression of eight different omp genes (alpA, alpB, babA, babB, babC, sabA, hopM, and oipA) in a set of 200 patient isolates, mostly from symptomatic children or young adults. Virtually all clinical isolates produced the AlpA and AlpB proteins, supporting their essential function. All other OMPs were produced at extremely variable rates, ranging from 35% to 73%, indicating a function in close adaptation to the individual host or gastric niche. In 11% of the isolates, BabA was produced, and SabA was produced in 5% of the isolates, but the strains failed to bind their cognate substrates. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in gastric cells was strictly dependent on the presence of the cag pathogenicity island, whereas the presence of OipA clearly enhanced IL-8 production. The presence of the translocated effector protein CagA correlated well with BabA and OipA production. In conclusion, we found unexpectedly diverse omp expression profiles in individual H. pylori strains and hypothesize that this reflects the selective pressure for adhesion, which may differ across different hosts as well as within an individual over time.",1,1,3,0,3
26246136,2015,"We examined the presence of possible Recent refugia of Pleistocene mammalian faunas in Eurasia by analysing regional differences in the mammalian species composition, occurrence and extinction rates between Recent and Last Glacial faunas. Our analyses revealed that most of the widespread Last Glacial species have survived in the central Palearctic continental regions, most prominently in Altai-Sayan (followed by Kazakhstan and East European Plain). The Recent Altai-Sayan and Kazakhstan regions show species compositions very similar to their Pleistocene counterparts. The Palearctic regions have lost 12% of their mammalian species during the last 109,000 years. The major patterns of the postglacial changes in Palearctic mammalian diversity were not extinctions but rather radical shifts of species distribution ranges. Most of the Pleistocene mammalian fauna retreated eastwards, to the central Eurasian steppes, instead of northwards to the Arctic regions, considered Holocene refugia of Pleistocene megafauna. The central Eurasian Altai and Sayan mountains could thus be considered a present-day refugium of the Last Glacial biota, including mammals. ",1,0,1,0,10
19278947,2009,"Latinos account for 15% of the US population, a proportion projected to grow to 30% by the year 2050. Although there is tremendous diversity within this community, commonalities of language, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors unite Latinos, making them more similar than different. Differences by national origin, although important, are attenuated when immigrants come to the United States, dominated by an English-language, Anglo-centric culture. For non-Latino and non-Spanish-speaking clinicians, communication barriers and cultural misunderstandings can impede the care of dying Latino patients and their families. We present the case of a young, pregnant, Spanish-speaking woman from Central America diagnosed with a fatal leukemia. As illustrated by this case, Latino immigrants face a number of external challenges to optimal end-of-life care: (1) geographic distance as well as political and economic realities often separate patients from their valued families; (2) undocumented immigrants are frequently uninsured and fear of deportation may create a barrier to accessing health services; (3) language and literacy barriers; and (4) concerns about discrimination. Other Latino issues that may be more pronounced in end-of-life settings include cultural themes and religious and spiritual influences. We recommend that professional interpreters must be used for discussions about goals of care with Spanish-speaking patients and families or when negotiating conflict between the patient, family, and the health care team. Concrete suggestions are provided for clinicians in working with interpreters, eliciting culturally based attitudes and beliefs, and implementing universal strategies for clear health communication.",1,1,9,6,7
7533081,1995,"Circulating spontaneous antibody-secreting cells (ASC) induced by mucosal and systemic immunizations in human volunteers have been characterized with respect to differentiation stage and homing commitments. Irrespective of the immunization route, the large majority of ASC co-expressed CD19 and HLA-DR, which are normally lost during the transition of plasmablasts to plasmocytes, as well as CD38, a marker of activated B cell blasts, expressed also by plasmocytes. However, these cells expressed neither CD28, a molecule acquired by plasmocytes, nor CD22 and CD37, which are lost during the transition of plasmablasts to plasmocytes. Therefore, the large majority of ASC found in peripheral blood after oral and parenteral immunizations are terminally differentiated B cells, but not fully differentiated plasmocytes. As a whole, the mucosally derived ASC population seemed to be more homogenously differentiated. CD25 was detected on few ASC, whereas ASC expressing CD71 were more numerous, especially among systemically derived ASC. Almost all ASC expressed the adhesion molecules CD44 and alpha 4-integrins, irrespective of immunization route. However, virtually all systemically derived ASC expressed L-selectin, recognizing the peripheral lymph node addressin, whereas only a minority of mucosally induced blood ASC expressed L-selectin. These studies are the first to demonstrate in humans that circulating precursors of mucosal B cell immunoblasts utilize organ-specific recognition mechanisms distinct from those of corresponding systemic B cells and appear to be more advanced in the B lineage maturation pathway. Specialization of receptor expression could explain both the unification of immune responses in diverse mucosal sites and the physiologic segregation of mucosal from non-mucosal immune mechanisms in humans.",1,0,1,0,0

23959392,2013,"OBJECTIVE:
That too few youth with special health care needs make the transition to adult-oriented health care successfully may be due, in part, to lack of readiness to transfer care. There is a lack of theoretical models to guide development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines, assessments, and interventions to improve transition readiness.
OBJECTIVE:
To further validate the Social-ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness to Transition (SMART) via feedback from stakeholders (patients, parents, and providers) from a medically diverse population in need of life-long follow-up care, survivors of childhood cancer.
METHODS:
Mixed-methods participatory research design.
METHODS:
A large Mid-Atlantic children's hospital.
METHODS:
Adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer (n = 14), parents (n = 18), and pediatric providers (n = 10).
METHODS:
Patients and parents participated in focus groups; providers participated in individual semi-structured interviews.
METHODS:
Validity of SMART was assessed 3 ways: (1) ratings on importance of SMART components for transition readiness using a 5-point scale (0-4; ratings >2 support validity), (2) nominations of 3 ""most important"" components, and (3) directed content analysis of focus group/interview transcripts.
RESULTS:
Qualitative data supported the validity of SMART, with minor modifications to definitions of components. Quantitative ratings met criteria for validity; stakeholders endorsed all components of SMART as important for transition. No additional SMART variables were suggested by stakeholders and the ""most important"" components varied by stakeholders, thus supporting the comprehensiveness of SMART and need to involve multiple perspectives.
CONCLUSIONS:
SMART represents a comprehensive and empirically validated framework for transition research and program planning, supported by survivors of childhood cancer, parents, and pediatric providers. Future research should validate SMART among other populations with special health care needs.

25862821,2015,"There is an urgent need for a better understanding of adaptive immunity to Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis that is frequently associated with sepsis or death in patients in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. The imperative to identify vaccine targets is driven both by the public health agenda in these regions and biological threat concerns. In several intracellular bacterial pathogens, alkyl hydroperoxidase reductases are upregulated as part of the response to host oxidative stress, and they can stimulate strong adaptive immunity. We show that alkyl hydroperoxidase reductase (AhpC) of B. pseudomallei is strongly immunogenic for T cells of 'humanized' HLA transgenic mice and seropositive human donors. Some T cell epitopes, such as p6, are able to bind diverse HLA class II heterodimers and stimulate strong T cell immunity in mice and humans. Importantly, patients with acute melioidosis who survive infection show stronger T cell responses to AhpC relative to those who do not. Although the sequence of AhpC is virtually invariant among global B. pseudomallei clinical isolates, a Cambodian isolate varies only in C-terminal truncation of the p6 T cell epitope, raising the possibility of selection by host immunity. This variant peptide is virtually unable to stimulate T cell immunity. For an infection in which there has been debate about centrality of T cell immunity in defense, these observations support a role for T cell immunity to AhpC in disease protection. ",1,0,1,0,5
17875779,2007,"OBJECTIVE:
The methylnitrosourea (MNU)-induced mammary cancer model in rats is similar to estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in women. In prevention studies using this model, tumor incidence and multiplicity were typically primary end points. The ability of various agents administered for a short period to modulate cell proliferation [proliferation index (PI)] and apoptosis [apoptotic index (AI)] in mammary cancers was compared with their efficacy in long-term prevention and therapy studies.
METHODS:
Rats were injected with MNU to induce mammary cancers. For the prevention studies, agents were administered by gavage or in the diet beginning 5 days after MNU. For proliferation (PI) and apoptosis (AI) experiments, animals with a palpable mammary cancer were treated with the agents for only 4 to 7 days. PI was determined following 5-bromodeoxyuridine labeling whereas AI was determined using the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by measuring cancer size over a 6-week period.
RESULTS:
Treatments with differing chemopreventive efficacy and mechanism(s) of action were examined: (a) hormonal treatments [tamoxifen, vorozole (an aromatase inhibitor), and ovariectomy]; (b) retinoid X receptor agonists (targretin, 9-cis retinoic acid, and UAB30); (c) inducers of drug-metabolizing enzymes (indole-3-carbinol, 5,6 benzoflavone, and diindoylmethane); (d) agents that alter signal transduction (R115777, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor); Iressa (an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor); sulindac and celecoxib (cyclooxygenase 1/2 and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors); and (e) diverse agents including meclizine, vitamin C, and sodium phenylbutyrate. Correlations between inhibition of PI, increase of AI, and chemopreventive efficacy were observed. Although most agents with moderate or low preventive efficacy suppressed PI, they minimally affected AI.
CONCLUSIONS:
The data confirmed that the short-term effects of various agents on cell proliferation and apoptosis in small mammary cancers can predict their preventive/therapeutic efficacy. Thus, these biomarkers can be used to help determine the efficacy of compounds in phase II clinical prevention trials.

10837657,1998,"Cellular interactions play a key role in diverse biological processes within the cardiovascular system. Targeting of leukocytes to sites of inflammation is viewed as a multistage process of sequential involvement of distinct adhesion molecules on the leukocyte and endothelial cell (EC) surface that is dictated by the local fluid dynamic environment. For neutrophils, the initial contact and rolling along the vessel wall are mediated primarily by selecting. Subsequent firm adhesion requires activation of neutrophil P, integrins and binding to their ligand ICAM-1 on the EC surface. The final step of this cascade of events includes neutrophil transmigration to extravascular tissue space. The neutrophil model of emigration in inflammation has been extended and refined to account for monocyte and T cell interactions with ECs. Platelet adhesion to thrombogenic surfaces (i.e. immobilized von Willebrand factor) under flow follows the general principles of leukocyte extravasation. More specifically, platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib alpha appears to mediate an initial selectin-like tethering platelet-vWf interaction, followed by alpha II beta beta 3 integrin activation and firm adhesion. Some of the signaling mechanisms associated with cellular interactions in inflammatory and thrombotic processes are discussed. These basic principles are also discussed in the context of tissue engineering research.",1,0,1,0,0

In addition, we observe that SPC24 knockdown can lead to attenuated cell growth, increased cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Consistent with the breast cancer cell results, the in vivo growth of the SPC24-knocking down cells was significantly inhibited. Interestingly, molecular analysis indicates that SPC24 regulates PI3K/AKT kinase pathway, indicating the important of SPC24 for clinical treatment.

This study examined the relationship between childhood experience and homelessness in psychiatric patients.
METHODS:
Three large and diverse samples of homeless patients (N = 512) were compared with a sample of patients who had never been homeless (N = 271), with respect to childhood experience of foster care, group home placement, and running away. One of the homeless samples and the never homeless sample were drawn from patients admitted to a state mental hospital. In this state hospital population, risk ratios for lifetime prevalence of homelessness could be derived.
RESULTS:
In the three homeless samples, over 15% had a history of foster care, over 10% had a history of group home placement, and over 20% had a history of running away. These figures compared with 2%, 1%, and 5%, respectively, in the never homeless sample. In the state hospital, the lifetime prevalence of homelessness in patients with any one of these childhood experiences was about threefold that of other patients. A history of homelessness was reported by the great majority of state hospital patients who had had one of these childhood experiences.

In two studies with large and diverse samples, ovulation had drastically different effects on single women and women in committed relationships. Ovulation led single women to become more liberal, less religious, and more likely to vote for Barack Obama. In contrast, ovulation led women in committed relationships to become more conservative, more religious, and more likely to vote for Mitt Romney. In addition, ovulation-induced changes in political orientation mediated women's voting behavior. Overall, the ovulatory cycle not only influences women's politics but also appears to do so differently for single women than for women in relationships.",1,1,8,0,0
31455278,2019,"BACKGROUND:
Previous research suggests that providing generalized information about the health implications of air pollution from fossil fuels may be effective at promoting public support for a transition to cleaner sources of energy. We sought to extend that work by identifying the specific messages about the health implications of air pollution from fossil fuels that are most and least concerning to people, and whether rankings of concern vary among different audiences. We also hypothesized that reading the statements would influence people's attitudes and behavioral intentions in a manner supportive of a transition to cleaner sources of energy.
METHODS:
We conducted a survey with a diverse sample of U.S. adults (n = 1644) from a non-probability internet panel. Using maximum difference scaling, participants ranked a set of ten statements that revealed which statements were the most and least concerning to them. We also measured attitudes about air pollution and energy use before and after the ranking exercise to assess changes in opinion caused by cumulative exposure to the messages.
RESULTS:
Across all sub-groups examined, participants were most concerned by a message about the neurological impacts of air pollution on babies and children. After the ranking exercise, participants expressed increases in perceived health harm of air pollution and fossil fuels, a desire for more clean energy, and intention to engage in consumer advocacy to support clean energy.
CONCLUSIONS:
To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess how people respond to information about the neurological health harms of air pollution from fossil fuels. While efforts to communicate the cardio-pulmonary health harms of air pollution are well established, our study suggests that efforts should now be organized to communicate the neurological effects of air pollution from fossil fuels, especially the neuro-developmental effects on babies and children.

28216317,2017,"Actin filaments assemble into a variety of networks to provide force for diverse cellular processes [1]. Tropomyosins are coiled-coil dimers that form head-to-tail polymers along actin filaments and regulate interactions of other proteins, including actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilins and myosins, with actin [2-5]. In mammals, >40 tropomyosin isoforms can be generated through alternative splicing from four tropomyosin genes. Different isoforms display non-redundant functions and partially non-overlapping localization patterns, for example within the stress fiber network [6, 7]. Based on cell biological studies, it was thus proposed that tropomyosin isoforms may specify the functional properties of different actin filament populations [2]. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the properties of actin filaments decorated by stress-fiber-associated tropomyosins (Tpm1.6, Tpm1.7, Tpm2.1, Tpm3.1, Tpm3.2, and Tpm4.2). These proteins bound F-actin with high affinity and competed with α-actinin for actin filament binding. Importantly, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of fluorescently tagged proteins revealed that most tropomyosin isoforms cannot co-polymerize with each other on actin filaments. These isoforms also bind actin with different dynamics, which correlate with their effects on actin-binding proteins. The long isoforms Tpm1.6 and Tpm1.7 displayed stable interactions with actin filaments and protected filaments from ADF/cofilin-mediated disassembly, but did not activate non-muscle myosin IIa (NMIIa). In contrast, the short isoforms Tpm3.1, Tpm3.2, and Tpm4.2 displayed rapid dynamics on actin filaments and stimulated the ATPase activity of NMIIa, but did not efficiently protect filaments from ADF/cofilin. Together, these data provide experimental evidence that tropomyosin isoforms segregate to different actin filaments and specify functional properties of distinct actin filament populations.",1,0,1,0,0

25618474,2015,"Psychological well-being has been widely researched along the psychosis spectrum, and increased psychotic symptoms are generally associated with worse well-being. Additionally, the construct of insight has been extensively studied in schizophrenia. While having greater insight has many benefits for those with schizophrenia, a paradox exists in which greater insight is also associated with poorer psychological well-being. However, it is unclear whether the link between insight and poor well-being occurs only once serious psychopathology has been established, or whether this is a more universal process seen even at lower levels on the psychosis spectrum. We used a structural modeling approach in an ethnically diverse, non-clinical sample of 420 undergraduates to evaluate the association between sub-clinical psychosis, cognitive insight and psychological well-being. As hypothesized, results indicated that sub-clinical psychotic symptoms were negatively associated with psychological well-being. The insight paradox was also substantiated, as greater cognitive insight was associated with worse psychological well-being. However, cognitive insight did not moderate the association between symptoms and well-being. The link between sub-clinical psychotic symptoms and psychological well-being as well as the insight paradox appears to emerge even before reaching threshold for a psychotic disorder.

21253019,2011,"Ralstonia solanacearum, which causes bacterial wilt of diverse plants, produces copious extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), a major virulence factor. The function of EPS in wilt disease is uncertain. Leading hypotheses are that EPS physically obstructs plant water transport, or that EPS cloaks the bacterium from host plant recognition and subsequent defense. Tomato plants infected with R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 strain UW551 and tropical strain GMI1000 upregulated genes in both the ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) defense signal transduction pathways. The horizontally wilt-resistant tomato line Hawaii7996 activated expression of these defense genes faster and to a greater degree in response to R. solanacearum infection than did susceptible cultivar Bonny Best. However, EPS played different roles in resistant and susceptible host responses to R. solanacearum. In susceptible plants the wild-type and eps(-) mutant strains induced generally similar defense responses. But in resistant Hawaii7996 tomato plants, the wild-type pathogens induced significantly greater defense responses than the eps(-) mutants, suggesting that the resistant host recognizes R. solanacearum EPS. Consistent with this idea, purified EPS triggered significant SA pathway defense gene expression in resistant, but not in susceptible, tomato plants. In addition, the eps(-) mutant triggered noticeably less production of defense-associated reactive oxygen species in resistant tomato stems and leaves, despite attaining similar cell densities in planta.

Sequence comparisons of louping ill envelope protein showed greater homology with tick-borne than mosquito-borne flaviviruses and greater homology with the western than the far eastern subtype of tick-borne encephalitis virus. With the capsid and membrane proteins, the degree of homology between louping ill and the western subtype was greater than that between the two subtypes, indicating very close evolutionary relationships between louping ill and the western subtype of tick-borne encephalitis. Thus, louping ill and tick-borne encephalitis may be varieties of a common tick-borne ancestral virus. The average amino acid sequence diversity between members of the tick-borne serogroup was significantly lower than that of mosquito-borne serogroups, suggesting that tick-borne flaviviruses have been subjected to different evolutionary immune selection pressure from the mosquito-borne viruses. Using the published model of tick-borne encephalitis envelope protein and our sequence data on louping ill virus, we have identified three discontinuous peptides (amino acids 81-88, 207-212, and 230-234) which may represent critical molecular determinants within the receptor binding site of tick-borne flaviviruses and may provide a specific genetic marker for these viruses.",1,0,1,0,4
20591820,2010,"BACKGROUND:
Sarcomas are a diverse group of difficult-to-treat connective tissue neoplasms. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been identified as a therapeutic target in many sarcomas and this article reviews the role of this pathway and updates clinical data for the available mTOR inhibitors.
METHODS:
Reference sources were selected by the author for searches in PubMed and EMBASE, with search terms dependent on the particular subtopic.
RESULTS:
mTOR is a protein kinase that regulates cell growth and proliferation and is abnormally activated in many human tumours. Several disruptions of phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase (PI3K)-Akt signalling are associated with different sarcoma types. The macrolide antibiotic rapamycin and synthetic derivatives sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus and ridaforolimus have been investigated in several tumour types and their potential for the treatment of sarcoma is being explored, with varying degrees of success. The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is also implicated in resistance mechanisms to antineoplastic therapies, and mTOR inhibitors therefore have the potential to restore sensitivity to patients with treatment-resistant disease.
CONCLUSIONS:
The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is an exciting target for therapy in many types of solid malignancies and its blockade represents an opportunity to improve outcomes in poor-prognosis sarcoma.

17719182,2007,"Cell-cell communication in astroglial syncytia is mediated by intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses elicited by extracellular signaling molecules as well as by diverse physical and chemical stimuli. Despite the evidence that astrocytic swelling promotes [Ca(2+)](i) elevation through Ca(2+) influx, the molecular identity of the channel protein underlying this response is still elusive. Here we report that primary cultured cortical astrocytes express the transient receptor potential vanilloid-related channel 4 (TRPV 4), a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel gated by a variety of stimuli, including cell swelling. Immunoblot and confocal microscopy analyses confirmed the presence of the channel protein and its localization in the plasma membrane. TRPV4 was functional because the selective TRPV4 agonist 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4alphaPDD) activated an outwardly rectifying cation current with biophysical and pharmacological properties that overlapped those of recombinant human TRPV4 expressed in COS cells. Moreover, 4alphaPDD and hypotonic challenge promoted [Ca(2+)](i) elevation mediated by influx of extracellular Ca(2+). This effect was abolished by low micromolar concentration of the TRPV4 inhibitor Ruthenium Red. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy of rat brain revealed that TRPV4 was enriched in astrocytic processes of the superficial layers of the neocortex and in astrocyte end feet facing pia and blood vessels. Collectively, these data indicate that cultured cortical astroglia express functional TRPV4 channels. They also demonstrate that TRPV4 is particularly abundant in astrocytic membranes at the interface between brain and extracerebral liquid spaces. Consistent with its roles in other tissues, these results support the view that TRPV4 might participate in astroglial osmosensation and thus play a key role in brain volume homeostasis.",1,0,1,0,0
28934269,2017,"'Responsible drinking' campaigns emerged in the early 1970s as a means of addressing hazardous drinking and its related consequences. While these were initially the product of public health agencies and health-related NGOs, they are increasingly being developed and disseminated by the alcohol industry. There is considerable debate as to whether industry-generated campaigns are designed to reduce hazardous drinking and related problems (as argued by their developers) or are designed to avoid government regulation or even to increase sales. The aim of the present study was to explore the way that recent industry-developed responsible drinking campaigns are perceived and interpreted by the general public. That is, do they promote low-risk drinking, promote risky drinking, or just muddy the waters. Two sub-studies were conducted. The first, a mall intercept study with 180 adults in two Australian shopping districts, explored participants' understanding of slogans/taglines. The second, an online survey with 480 Australian adults, explored understandings and interpretations of television/online commercials. The results of the two studies revealed diversity in participants' interpretation of the 'responsible drinking' advertisements. Terminology utilised in industry-developed advertisements was found to be ambiguous; for example, what age group was being referred to in the tagline 'Kids and alcohol don't mix', and whether 'Drink Properly' meant not drinking to excess or drinking in a way that made you look more sophisticated. In Study Two, the government-developed campaign ('Know when to say when') was clearly interpreted as warning against risky consumption of alcohol; whereas the industry-developed campaigns ('How to drink properly', 'Kids absorb your drinking', 'Friends are waiting') were interpreted to have a range of different meanings, including some seemingly unrelated to alcohol. These findings are consistent with the literature evaluating anti-smoking campaigns developed by the tobacco industry, and previous research showing that industry communications serve to soften public opinion and create the impression of a 'socially responsible' industry but are likely to be less effective than initiatives focused on the availability and promotion of alcohol.",1,1,4,0,2
19028389,2008,"OBJECTIVE:
To pilot a practice-directed intervention to promote growth interpretation and lifestyle counseling during child health supervision visits.
METHODS:
The intervention at 4 diverse primary care practices included education, facilitation by a practice-change leadership team, tools, and guidance from the study team. Preintervention and postintervention evaluations used were clinician interviews, in-office surveys of parents, 1-month post-visit telephone survey, visit observations, and medical record reviews. Outcomes evaluated growth interpretation documentation, clinician recognition of overweight, topic discussed at health supervision visit, and parental visit content recall and health behavior changes.
RESULTS:
The intervention was well accepted, and tools provided were deemed helpful. Documentation of growth interpretation was higher after intervention (pre versus post: 32% vs 87%; P< .001). Parent reports of topics discussed were similar between evaluation periods (pre versus post: growth 96% vs 99%; diet 90% vs 93%; physical activity 81% vs 85%). Observed topics at health supervision visits were similarly high and were unchanged between periods. Parental recall of topics at 1 month was also high and similar between periods. Parental report of adoption of a healthier behavior for themselves or their child at 1 month did not significantly change.
CONCLUSIONS:
The Systematic Nutritional Assessment in Pediatric Practice intervention provides a promising model to increase interpretation and documentation of growth.

Combining the production of two or more drugs into a single batch could not only be useful for research, clinical studies, and urgent therapies but also effective when combination therapies are needed or where resources are scarce. Here we propose strategies to concurrently produce multiple biologics from yeast in single batches by multiplexing strain development, cell culture, separation, and purification. We demonstrate proof-of-concept for three biologics co-production strategies: (i) inducible expression of multiple biologics and control over the ratio between biologic drugs produced together; (ii) consolidated bioprocessing; and (iii) co-expression and co-purification of a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies. We then use these basic strategies to produce drug mixtures as well as to separate drugs. These strategies offer a diverse array of options for on-demand, flexible, low-cost, and decentralized biomanufacturing applications without the need for specialized equipment.",1,0,1,0,0
33159885,2020,"A unique and complex microstructure underlies the diverse functions of the liver. Breakdown of this organization, as occurs in fibrosis and cirrhosis, impairs liver function and leads to disease. The role of integrin β1 was examined both in establishing liver microstructure and recreating it after injury. Embryonic deletion of integrin β1 in the liver disrupts the normal development of hepatocyte polarity, specification of cell-cell junctions, and canalicular formation. This action in turn leads to expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and widespread fibrosis. Targeted deletion of integrin β1 in adult hepatocytes prevents recreation of normal hepatocyte architecture after liver injury, with resultant fibrosis. In vitro, integrin β1 is essential for canalicular formation and is needed to prevent stellate cell activation by modulating TGF-β. Taken together, these findings identify integrin β1 as a key determinant of liver architecture with a critical role as a regulator of TGF-β secretion. These results suggest that disrupting the hepatocyte-extracellular matrix interaction is sufficient to drive fibrosis.",1,1,2,0,0
17558964,2007,"It is widely acknowledged that integrating fossils into data sets of extant taxa is imperative for proper placement of fossils, resolution of relationships, and a better understanding of character evolution. The importance of this process has been further magnified because of the crucial role of fossils in dating divergence times. Outstanding issues remain, including appropriate methods to place fossils in phylogenetic trees, the importance of molecules versus morphology in these analyses, as well as the impact of potentially large amounts of missing data for fossil taxa. In this study we used the angiosperm clade Juglandaceae as a model for investigating methods of integrating fossils into a phylogenetic framework of extant taxa. The clade has a rich fossil record relative to low extant diversity, as well as a robust molecular phylogeny and morphological database for extant taxa. After combining fossil organ genera into composite and terminal taxa, our objectives were to (1) compare multiple methods for the integration of the fossils and extant taxa (including total evidence, molecular scaffolds, and molecular matrix representation with parsimony [MRP]); (2) explore the impact of missing data (incomplete taxa and characters) and the evidence for placing fossils on the topology; (3) simulate the phylogenetic effect of missing data by creating ""artificial fossils""; and (4) place fossils and compare the impact of single and multiple fossil constraints in estimating the age of clades. Despite large and variable amounts of missing data, each of the methods provided reasonable placement of both fossils and simulated ""artificial fossils"" in the phylogeny previously inferred only from extant taxa. Our results clearly show that the amount of missing data in any given taxon is not by itself an operational guideline for excluding fossils from analysis. Three fossil taxa (Cruciptera simsonii, Paleoplatycarya wingii, and Platycarya americana) were placed within crown clades containing living taxa for which relationships previously had been suggested based on morphology, whereas Polyptera manningii, a mosaic taxon with equivocal affinities, was placed firmly as sister to two modern crown clades. The position of Paleooreomunnea stoneana was ambiguous with total evidence but conclusive with DNA scaffolds and MRP. There was less disturbance of relationships among extant taxa using a total evidence approach, and the DNA scaffold approach did not provide improved resolution or internal support for clades compared to total evidence, whereas weighted MRP retained comparable levels of support but lost crown clade resolution. Multiple internal minimum age constraints generally provided reasonable age estimates, but the use of single constraints provided by extinct genera tended to underestimate clade ages.",1,1,4,0,1
1986988,1991,"The relation between sodium and blood pressure is a centuries-old question. A substantial body of epidemiological and experimental data has accumulated that strongly implicates NaCl as having a causal role in the genesis of arterial hypertension. Prospective studies that have been performed in diverse populations that have manipulated NaCl exposure by diet or infusion have repeatedly documented an NaCl pressor effect. Further, similar studies in biracial populations have also demonstrated a greater prevalence of ""salt sensitivity"" in blacks compared with whites. The reasons for this observation are not entirely clear; however, intrinsic or hypertension-induced renal abnormalities that limit natriuretic capacity, reduced Na+,K(+)-ATPase pump activity, other membrane ion transport disturbances, differential exposure to psychological stressors, greater insulin resistance, and dietary factors (reduced Ca+ and K+ intake) have all been suggested as possibly playing a role. Salt sensitivity appears to be a widespread phenomenon. However, it is critically important to determine what factors account for racial differences in salt sensitivity. Moreover, the prevalence of salt sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Current definitions of salt sensitivity are varied and unidirectional. In comparison with bidirectional criteria (blood pressure increase with salt loading and blood pressure decrease with salt restriction), they are probably inadequate to identify salt-sensitive individuals who manifest less extreme blood pressure change after dietary sodium or plasma volume manipulations. More sensitive criteria for diagnosing salt sensitivity will facilitate a better understanding of racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of salt sensitivity.",1,1,5,5,5

21663628,2011,"BACKGROUND:
The eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) genome is relatively unexplored, especially compared to those of the other major Solanaceae crops tomato and potato. In particular, no SNP markers are publicly available; on the other hand, over 1,000 SSR markers were developed and publicly available. We have combined the recently developed Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) approach with Illumina DNA sequencing for rapid and mass discovery of both SNP and SSR markers for eggplant.
RESULTS:
RAD tags were generated from the genomic DNA of a pair of eggplant mapping parents, and sequenced to produce ~17.5 Mb of sequences arrangeable into ~78,000 contigs. The resulting non-redundant genomic sequence dataset consisted of ~45,000 sequences, of which ~29% were putative coding sequences and ~70% were in common between the mapping parents. The shared sequences allowed the discovery of ~10,000 SNPs and nearly 1,000 indels, equivalent to a SNP frequency of 0.8 per Kb and an indel frequency of 0.07 per Kb. Over 2,000 of the SNPs are likely to be mappable via the Illumina GoldenGate assay. A subset of 384 SNPs was used to successfully fingerprint a panel of eggplant germplasm, producing a set of informative diversity data. The RAD sequences also included nearly 2,000 putative SSRs, and primer pairs were designed to amplify 1,155 loci.
CONCLUSIONS:
The high throughput sequencing of the RAD tags allowed the discovery of a large number of DNA markers, which will prove useful for extending our current knowledge of the genome organization of eggplant, for assisting in marker-aided selection and for carrying out comparative genomic analyses within the Solanaceae family.

'Modeling for Fidelity' (MFF) centers on an extended mentor relationship between teachers and biomedical scientists carried out in a virtual format in conjunction with extensive online educative materials. Four teachers from different diverse high schools in Massachusetts and Ohio who experienced MFF contextualized to a 6-week Neurological Disorders curriculum with the same science mentor were compared to a teacher who had experienced an intensive in-person professional development contextualized to the same curriculum with the same mentor. Fidelity of implementation was measured directly using an established metric and indirectly via student performance. The results show that teachers valued MFF, particularly the mentor relationship and were able to use it effectively to ensure critical components of the learning objectives were preserved. Moreover their students performed equivalently to those whose teacher had experienced intensive in-person professional development. Participants in all school settings demonstrated large (Cohen's d>2.0) and significant (p<0.0001 per-post) changes in conceptual knowledge as well as self-efficacy towards learning about neurological disorders (Cohen's d>1.5, p<0.0001 pre-post).

26887497,2016,"Integration of the reverse-transcribed viral DNA into the host genome is an essential step in the life cycle of retroviruses. Retrovirus integrase catalyses insertions of both ends of the linear viral DNA into a host chromosome. Integrase from HIV-1 and closely related retroviruses share the three-domain organization, consisting of a catalytic core domain flanked by amino- and carboxy-terminal domains essential for the concerted integration reaction. Although structures of the tetrameric integrase-DNA complexes have been reported for integrase from prototype foamy virus featuring an additional DNA-binding domain and longer interdomain linkers, the architecture of a canonical three-domain integrase bound to DNA remained elusive. Here we report a crystal structure of the three-domain integrase from Rous sarcoma virus in complex with viral and target DNAs. The structure shows an octameric assembly of integrase, in which a pair of integrase dimers engage viral DNA ends for catalysis while another pair of non-catalytic integrase dimers bridge between the two viral DNA molecules and help capture target DNA. The individual domains of the eight integrase molecules play varying roles to hold the complex together, making an extensive network of protein-DNA and protein-protein contacts that show both conserved and distinct features compared with those observed for prototype foamy virus integrase.

However, the diverse microtubule configurations found in different cell types may not be generated and maintained by MTOCs alone. Work over the last few years has revealed a mechanism that has the capacity to generate cell-type-specific microtubule arrays independently of a specific organizer: nucleation of microtubules from the lateral surface of pre-existing microtubules. This type of nucleation requires cooperation between two different multi-subunit protein complexes, augmin and the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC).

A computed tomography (CT) study of the morphology of the C1 vertebra.
OBJECTIVE:
Is to determine the prevalence of ponticulus posticus (PP) by analyzing CT scans performed on a large, diverse population in the northeast United States. This study also proposes a CT-based classification system both to aid in unifying the description of PP, and to aid in future research.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:
The prevalence of PP varies from 5% to 68% in published studies. There may be geographic variation in the prevalence of PP. Our objective was to establish the prevalence of PP in the general population, and to develop a comprehensive classification system to describe PP.
METHODS:
We evaluated cervical spine CT scans performed on patients in the emergency room of a level I trauma center over a 1-year period (January 1, 2014-December 31, 2014). The CT images were evaluated for the presence of a PP, and if present the following demographic data were collected: age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI). We propose a novel classification system to standardize the description of PP identified on CT scan.
RESULTS:
Two thousand, nine hundred and seventeen cervical spine CT scans were reviewed in this study. The prevalence of PP was 22.5%. Men had a higher prevalence of PP than women (53.5% male vs. 46.5% female P ≤ 0.01). When compared with the overall population, African-Americans were more likely to have a PP (P ≤ 0.01), while Caucasian patients were less likely (P ≤ 0.01). The novel classification consisted of a two letter designation for each patient, with the first letter denoting the right sided arch and the second letter the left sided arch. Each side of the arch described as an A, B, or C type. The A type had no presence of a PP, B type had in incomplete PP, and C type had a complete PP. The most common type of a PP was CC encompassing 25% of the patients. The presence of a PP was more common in the left sided arch than the right side (B and C type Left 89.2% vs. B and C type Right 84.7%, P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION:
We found a 22.5% prevalence of PP in 2917 patients undergoing a cervical spine CT. This is the largest study to evaluating the prevalence of PP.

21670282,2011,"Mutations in the serine-threonine kinase with-no-lysine 4 (WNK4) cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHAII), a Mendelian form of human hypertension. WNK4 regulates diverse ion transporters in the kidney, and dysregulation of renal transporters is considered the main cause of the WNK4 mutation-associated hypertension. Another determinant of hypertension is vascular tone that is regulated by Ca(2+)-dependent blood vessel constriction. However, the role of WNK4 in vasoconstriction as part of its function to regulate blood pressure is not known. Here, we report that WNK4 is a unique modulator of blood pressure by restricting Ca(2+) influx via the transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3) channel in the vasculature. Loss of WNK4 markedly augmented TRPC3-mediated Ca(2+) influx in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in response to α-adrenoreceptor stimulation, which is the pathological hallmark of hypertension in resistance arteries. Notably, WNK4 depletion induced hypertrophic cell growth in VSMCs and increased vasoconstriction in small mesenteric arteries via TRPC3-mediated Ca(2+) influx. In addition, WNK4 mutants harboring the Q562E PHAII-causing or the D318A kinase-inactive mutation failed to mediate TRPC3 inhibition. These results define a previously undescribed function of WNK4 and reveal a unique therapeutic target to control blood pressure in WNK4-related hypertension.",1,0,1,0,0

Neisseria meningitidis is a diverse commensal bacterium that occasionally causes severe invasive disease. The relationship between meningococcal genotype and capsular polysaccharide, the principal virulence factor and vaccine component, was investigated in carried meningococci isolated from 8000 children and young adults in Bavaria, Germany.
METHODS:
Of the 830 meningococci isolated (carriage rate, 10.4%) by microbiological techniques, 822 were characterized by serogrouping, multilocus sequence typing, and genetic analysis of the capsule region. Statistical and population genetic analyses were applied to these data.
RESULTS:
The rapid increase in carriage rates with age of carrier, the low prevalence of hyperinvasive meningococci, and the relative prevalence of the 4 disease-associated serogroups were consistent with earlier observations. There was no genetic structuring of the meningococcal population by age of carrier or sampling location; however, there was significant geographic structuring of the meningococci isolated in civil, but not military, institutions. The rate of capsule gene expression did not vary with age of carrier or meningococcal genotype, except for serogroup C, for which increased expression was associated with ST-11 (formerly ET-37) complex meningococci.

Employing different banding techniques, we studied the chromosomes of 25 species of Boana and 3 of Hyloscirtus; thus providing, for the first time, data for Hyloscirtus and for 15 species of Boana. Most species showed karyotypes with 2n = 2x = 24 chromosomes; some species of the B. albopunctata group have 2n = 2x = 22, and H. alytolylax has 2n = 2x = 20. Karyotypes are all bi-armed in most species presented, with the exception of H. larinopygion (FN = 46) and H. alytolylax (FN = 38), with karyotypes that have a single pair of small telocentric chromosomes. In most species of Boana, NORs are observed in a single pair of chromosomes, mostly in the small chromosomes, although in some species of the B. albopunctata, B. pulchella, and B. semilineata groups, this marker occurs on the larger pairs 8, 1, and 7, respectively. In Hyloscirtus, NOR position differs in the three studied species: H. alytolylax (4p), H. palmeri (4q), and H. larinopygion (1p).

By alternative splicing, Dscam encodes a vast number of cell-surface proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily. We demonstrate that interactions between identical Dscam isoforms on the cell surface underlie self-recognition, while the cytoplasmic tail converts this recognition to dendrite repulsion. Sister dendrites expressing the same isoforms engage in homophilic repulsion. By contrast, Dscam diversity ensures that inappropriate repulsive interactions between dendrites sharing the same receptive field do not occur.

25719719,2015,"BACKGROUND:
All combinations of harvesting, processing, and injection have been attempted to maximize fat graft take following transplantation. Two theories behind fat transplantation have been proposed: cell survival and host replacement. Although the cell survival theory states that fat cells survive and undergo neovascularization following transfer, host replacement theory predicts adipocyte necrosis and replacement of cells by host tissues. Whether or not transferred fat survives, proliferates, or is replaced by fibrous tissue is relevant for the investment of future resources into this thriving field of research.
METHODS:
A literature search of the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases was performed for studies focusing on the histology of grafted fat after transplantation up to December of 2013. Histologic examinations of grafted fat were reviewed and compared in humans and animals.
RESULTS:
Sixty-six articles met inclusion criteria, and eight of them were human studies. There was widespread diversity in the method of fat harvest and transfer among the studies, and the date of examination after transfer. Many studies reported the presence of viable adipocytes, although an extensive amount of fibrosis and inflammatory infiltration was also seen, depending on the period of examination.
CONCLUSIONS:
Free fat grafts show a variable response following transplantation, with significant disagreement in the reported evidence. Although neovascularization and preservation of adipocyte architecture appear possible, other fat grafts are completely replaced by necrotic ghost cells and fibrotic ingrowth. Adipocyte survival likely contributes to volume maintenance, but fibrosis may also play a role.

There are an estimated 9.4 million cases of foodborne illness each year. Consumers have a key role in preventing foodborne illness, but differences in the practice of food safety behaviors exist, increasing risk for certain groups in the population. Identifying groups who are more likely to practice risky food safety behaviors can assist in development of interventions to reduce the disease burden of foodborne illnesses. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationships of health indicators and psychosocial factors with self-reported food safety behaviors.
RESULTS:
Data were collected via questionnaire from 153 African Americans who attend churches in Baltimore City. Individuals reported high overall concern with food safety (mean score: 0.80±0.49 on a scale of -1 to +1) and practiced food safety behaviors with moderate overall frequency (mean score: 5.26±4.01 on a scale of -12 to +12), with considerable variation in reported frequencies depending on the food safety behavior. After adjusting for demographic variables, food safety behaviors were significantly associated with BMI and psychosocial variables. Riskier food safety behaviors were associated with higher body mass index (BMI) (β = -0.141 95%CI (-0.237, -0.044), p = 0.004). Self-efficacy for healthy eating (standard β [std. β] = 0.250, p = 0.005) and healthy eating intentions (std. β = 0.178, p = 0.041) were associated with better food safety behaviors scores.

These results show important relationships between weight-related health indicators, psychosocial factors and food safety behaviors that have not previously been studied. Interventions tailored to higher-risk populations have the potential to reduce the burden of food-related illnesses. Additional studies are needed to further investigate these relationships with larger and more diverse samples.

31071128,2019,"This study sought to examine the interactive relations of socioeconomic status and race to corticolimbic regions that may play a key role in translating stress to the poor health outcomes overrepresented among those of lower socioeconomic status and African American race. Participants were 200 community-dwelling, self-identified African American and White adults from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span SCAN study. Brain volumes were derived using T1-weighted MP-RAGE images. Socioeconomic status by race interactions were observed for right medial prefrontal cortex (B = .26, p = .014), left medial prefrontal cortex (B = .26, p = .017), left orbital prefrontal cortex (B = .22, p = .037), and left anterior cingulate cortex (B = .27, p = .018), wherein higher socioeconomic status Whites had greater volumes than all other groups. Additionally, higher versus lower socioeconomic status persons had greater right and left hippocampal (B = -.15, p = .030; B = -.19, p = .004, respectively) and amygdalar (B = -.17, p = .015; B = -.21; p = .002, respectively) volumes. Whites had greater right and left hippocampal (B = -.17, p = .012; B = -.20, p = .003, respectively), right orbital prefrontal cortex (B = -.34, p < 0.001), and right anterior cingulate cortex (B = -.18, p = 0.011) volumes than African Americans. Among many factors, the higher levels of lifetime chronic stress associated with lower socioeconomic status and African American race may adversely affect corticolimbic circuitry. These relations may help explain race- and socioeconomic status-related disparities in adverse health outcomes.",1,1,15,12,12
15654106,2005,"The population structure of domesticated species is influenced by the natural history of the populations of predomesticated ancestors, as well as by the breeding system and complexity of the breeding practices exercised by humans. Within Oryza sativa, there is an ancient and well-established divergence between the two major subspecies, indica and japonica, but finer levels of genetic structure are suggested by the breeding history. In this study, a sample of 234 accessions of rice was genotyped at 169 nuclear SSRs and two chloroplast loci. The data were analyzed to resolve the genetic structure and to interpret the evolutionary relationships between groups. Five distinct groups were detected, corresponding to indica, aus, aromatic, temperate japonica, and tropical japonica rices. Nuclear and chloroplast data support a closer evolutionary relationship between the indica and the aus and among the tropical japonica, temperate japonica, and aromatic groups. Group differences can be explained through contrasting demographic histories. With the availability of rice genome sequence, coupled with a large collection of publicly available genetic resources, it is of interest to develop a population-based framework for the molecular analysis of diversity in O. sativa.",1,0,1,0,0
21448272,2011,"BACKGROUND:
All plants in nature harbor a diverse community of rhizosphere bacteria which can affect the plant growth. Our samples are isolated from the rhizosphere of wild barley Hordeum spontaneum at the Evolution Canyon ('EC'), Israel. The bacteria which have been living in close relationship with the plant root under the stressful conditions over millennia are likely to have developed strategies to alleviate plant stress.
RESULTS:
We studied distribution of culturable bacteria in the rhizosphere of H. spontaneum and characterized the bacterial 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCd) production, biofilm production, phosphorus solubilization and halophilic behavior. We have shown that the H. spontaneum rhizosphere at the stressful South Facing Slope (SFS) harbors significantly higher population of ACCd producing biofilm forming phosphorus solubilizing osmotic stress tolerant bacteria.
CONCLUSIONS:
The long-lived natural laboratory 'EC' facilitates the generation of theoretical testable and predictable models of biodiversity and genome evolution on the area of plant microbe interactions. It is likely that the bacteria isolated at the stressful SFS offer new opportunities for the biotechnological applications in our agro-ecological systems.

27601522,2016,"Understanding the genetic structure and transmission dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in malaria-endemic regions is crucial before the implementation of interventions. Located in a high-transmission region of western Kenya where P. falciparum is the predominant species, the Lake Victoria islands are ideal for feasibility of malaria elimination studies. We analyzed genetic variation in eight microsatellite loci to examine parasite population structure and gene flow patterns across five sites. High levels of genetic diversity were measured throughout the region (mean heterozygosity index = 0.84). The overall fixation index value between the sites was 0.044, indicating that approximately 5% of the overall allelic variation is due to differences between the populations. Based on these results, we concluded that parasite population structure in the studied islands is shaped by human migration patterns that maintain extensive parasite gene flow between the sites. Consequently, any malaria elimination and interventions strategies in the study area will have to be carried out broadly on all four islands and adjoining mainland region.",1,0,1,0,3
9554895,1998,"OBJECTIVE:
To assess the medical and psychosocial effects of early hospital discharge after surgery for breast cancer on complication rate, patient satisfaction, and psychosocial outcomes.
METHODS:
Randomised trial comparing discharge from hospital 4 days after surgery (with drain in situ) with discharge after drain removal (mean 9 days in hospital). Psychosocial measurements performed before surgery and 1 and 4 months after.
METHODS:
General hospital and cancer clinic in Rotterdam with a socioeconomically diverse population.
METHODS:
125 women with operable breast cancer.
METHODS:
Incidence of complications after surgery for breast cancer, patient satisfaction with treatment, and psychosocial effects of short stay or long stay in hospital.
RESULTS:
Patient satisfaction with the short stay in hospital was high; only 4% (2/56 at 1 month after surgery and 2/52 at 4 months after surgery) of patients indicated that they would have preferred a longer stay. There were no significant differences in duration of drainage from the axilla between the short stay and long stay groups (median 8 v 9 days respectively, P=0.45) or the incidence of wound complications (10 patients v 9 patients). The median number of seroma aspirations per patient was higher for the long stay group (1 v 3.5, P=0.04). Leakage along the drain occurred more frequently in short stay patients (21 v 10 patients, P=0.04). The two groups did not differ in scores for psychosocial problems (uncertainty, anxiety, loneliness, disturbed sleep, loss of control, threat to self esteem), physical or psychological complaints, or in the coping strategies used. Before surgery, short stay patients scored higher on scales of depression (P=0.03) and after surgery they were more likely to discuss their disease with their families (at 1 month P=0.004, at 4 months P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS:
Early discharge from hospital after surgery for breast cancer is safe and is well received by patients. Early discharge seems to enhance the opportunity for social support within the family.

As the genetic diversity in GvHD complicates the systematic discovery of associated variants across populations, we studied 122 GvHD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 492 HLA-matched sibling HSCT donor-recipient pairs from Finland and Spain. The association between these candidate SNPs and grade III-IV acute GvHD and extensive chronic GvHD was assessed. The functional effects of the variants were determined using expression and cytokine quantitative trait loci (QTL) database analyses. Clear heterogeneity was observed in the associated markers between the two populations. Interestingly, the majority of markers, such as those annotated to IL1, IL23R, TLR9, TNF, and NOD2 genes, are related to the immunological response by monocytes-macrophages to microbes, a step that precedes GvHD as a result of intestinal lesions. Furthermore, cytokine QTL analysis showed that the GvHD-associated markers regulate IL1β, IFNγ, and IL6 responses. These results support a crucial role for the anti-microbial response in GvHD risk. Furthermore, despite apparent heterogeneity in the genetic markers associated with GvHD, it was possible to identify a biological pathway shared by most markers in both populations.",1,0,1,0,2

We use survey data for the years 2004 and 2015 to construct population-level gender-specific subjective length of life (or subjective life expectancy) in people between 60 and 90 years of age. Using a specially designed statistical approach based on survival analysis, we compare people's estimated subjective life expectancies with those actually observed. We find subjective life expectancies to be lower than actual life expectancies for both genders in 2004. In 2015 men become more realistic in the sense that their subjective life expectancy is close to what was actually observed, while women retain their subjective expectations of a shorter than actual life expectancy. These results help to better understand how people might construct diverse decisions related to their remaining life course.",1,1,6,0,1

28727759,2017,"Bacteria use a variety of stress-sensing systems to sense and respond to diverse stressors and to ensure their survival under adverse conditions. The gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis responds to energy stress (ATP depletion) and to environmental stressors using two distinct stress-sensing pathways that converge on the alternative sigma factor σB to provoke a general stress response. Past efforts to study the σB stress response in bulk culture and on agarose pads were unable to visualize the responses of individual cells under tightly controlled conditions for extended periods of time. Here we use a microfluidics-based strategy to discern the basic features of σB activation in single cells in response to energy and environmental stress, both immediately upon stressor exposure and for tens of generations thereafter. Upon energy stress at various levels of stressor, cells exhibited fast, transient, and amplitude-modulated responses but not frequency modulation as previously reported. Upon environmental stress, which is mediated by the stressosome complex, wild-type cells primarily exhibited a transient and amplitude-modulated response. However, mutant cells producing only one of the four paralogous RsbR stressosome proteins showed striking and previously unseen differences. Whereas RsbRA-only cells mimicked the wild type, RsbRC-only cells displayed a slower but sustained overall response composed of repeated activation events in single cells.",1,0,1,0,0

18389059,2008,"A central question in genomic imprinting is how a specific sequence is recognized as the target for epigenetic marking. In both mammals and plants, imprinted genes are often associated with tandem repeats and transposon-related sequences, but the role of these elements in epigenetic gene silencing remains elusive. FWA is an imprinted gene in Arabidopsis thaliana expressed specifically in the female gametophyte and endosperm. Tissue-specific and imprinted expression of FWA depends on DNA methylation in the FWA promoter, which is comprised of two direct repeats containing a sequence related to a SINE retroelement. Methylation of this element causes epigenetic silencing, but it is not known whether the methylation is targeted to the SINE-related sequence itself or the direct repeat structure is also necessary. Here we show that the repeat structure in the FWA promoter is highly diverse in species within the genus Arabidopsis. Four independent tandem repeat formation events were found in three closely related species. Another related species, A. halleri, did not have a tandem repeat in the FWA promoter. Unexpectedly, even in this species, FWA expression was imprinted and the FWA promoter was methylated. In addition, our expression analysis of FWA gene in vegetative tissues revealed high frequency of intra-specific variation in the expression level. In conclusion, we show that the tandem repeat structure is dispensable for the epigenetic silencing of the FWA gene. Rather, SINE-related sequence is sufficient for imprinting, vegetative silencing, and targeting of DNA methylation. Frequent independent tandem repeat formation events in the FWA promoter led us to propose that they may be a consequence, rather than cause, of the epigenetic control. The possible significance of epigenetic variation in reproductive strategies during evolution is also discussed.",1,1,2,0,0
22872870,2012,"Recent work using culture-independent methods suggests that the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients harbor a vast array of bacteria not conventionally implicated in CF lung disease. However, sampling lung secretions in living subjects requires that expectorated specimens or collection devices pass through the oropharynx. Thus, contamination could confound results. Here, we compared culture-independent analyses of throat and sputum specimens to samples directly obtained from the lungs at the time of transplantation. We found that CF lungs with advanced disease contained relatively homogenous populations of typical CF pathogens. In contrast, upper-airway specimens from the same subjects contained higher levels of microbial diversity and organisms not typically considered CF pathogens. Furthermore, sputum exhibited day-to-day variation in the abundance of nontypical organisms, even in the absence of clinical changes. These findings suggest that oropharyngeal contamination could limit the accuracy of DNA-based measurements on upper-airway specimens. This work highlights the importance of sampling procedures for microbiome studies and suggests that methods that account for contamination are needed when DNA-based methods are used on clinical specimens.",1,0,1,0,0
30651307,2019,"Biodiversity in natural systems can be maintained either because niche differentiation among competitors facilitates stable coexistence or because equal fitness among neutral species allows for their long-term cooccurrence despite a slow drift toward extinction. Whereas the relative importance of these two ecological mechanisms has been well-studied in the absence of evolution, the role of local adaptive evolution in maintaining biological diversity through these processes is less clear. Here we study the contribution of local adaptive evolution to coexistence in a landscape of interconnected patches subject to disturbance. Under these conditions, early colonists to empty patches may adapt to local conditions sufficiently fast to prevent successful colonization by other preadapted species. Over the long term, the iteration of these local-scale priority effects results in niche convergence of species at the regional scale even though species tend to monopolize local patches. Thus, the dynamics evolve from stable coexistence through niche differentiation to neutral cooccurrence at the landscape level while still maintaining strong local niche segregation. Our results show that neutrality can emerge at the regional scale from local, niche-based adaptive evolution, potentially resolving why ecologists often observe neutral distribution patterns at the landscape level despite strong niche divergence among local communities.",1,0,1,0,0
18443001,2008,"Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular process involved in the turnover of most cellular constituents and in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. It is well-established that the basal autophagic activity of living cells decreases with age, thus contributing to the accumulation of damaged macromolecules during aging. Conversely, the activity of this catabolic pathway is required for lifespan extension in animal models such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In this work, we describe the unexpected finding that Zmpste24-null mice, which show accelerated aging and are a reliable model of human Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, exhibit an extensive basal activation of autophagy instead of the characteristic decline in this process occurring during normal aging. We also show that this autophagic increase is associated with a series of changes in lipid and glucose metabolic pathways, which resemble those occurring in diverse situations reported to prolong lifespan. These Zmpste24(-/-) mice metabolic alterations are also linked to substantial changes in circulating blood parameters, such as leptin, glucose, insulin or adiponectin which in turn lead to peripheral LKB1-AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition. On the basis of these results, we propose that nuclear abnormalities causing premature aging in Zmpste24(-/-) mice trigger a metabolic response involving the activation of autophagy. However, the chronic activation of this catabolic pathway may turn an originally intended pro-survival strategy into a pro-aging mechanism and could contribute to the systemic degeneration and weakening observed in these progeroid mice.",1,1,7,0,0

12359684,2002,"OBJECTIVE:
The well-documented association between maladaptive personality traits and substance use disorders has given rise to diverse explanatory models. In this investigation the authors examined one such explanation, that certain personality traits are familial risk factors for the development of substance abuse or dependence.
METHODS:
Data were collected from a controlled family study using direct diagnostic interviews. The Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire was used to assess the personality traits of 325 probands, 205 of whom had diagnoses of substance abuse or dependence, and 262 of their first-degree relatives.
RESULTS:
Probands with substance use disorders scored higher on alienation and negative emotionality than did probands without substance use disorders, and they scored lower on control, harm avoidance, and constraint. Relatives with substance use disorders also differed from relatives without these conditions on several of these same dimensions. To examine whether such personality traits could be conceptualized as familial risk factors for substance use disorders, a second set of analyses were limited to relatives without substance use disorders themselves but varying in terms of family history for these conditions. These groups of relatives did not differ significantly from each other on any of the identified personality traits.
CONCLUSIONS:
These findings argue for caution in characterizing the personality correlates of substance use disorders as representing familial or heritable risk factors.

However, the protein binding partners and mechanisms of action of these SO are not yet fully understood. Here we characterize the putative target profile of one SO, CDDO-Imidazolide (CDDO-Im), by combining affinity purification with mass spectroscopic proteomic analysis to identify 577 candidate binding proteins in whole cells. This SO pharmaco-interactome consists of a diverse but interconnected set of signaling networks; bioinformatic analysis of the protein interactome identified canonical signaling pathways targeted by the SO, including retinoic acid receptor (RAR), estrogen receptor (ER), insulin receptor (IR), janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Pull-down studies then further validated a subset of the putative targets. In addition, we now show for the first time that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a direct target of CDDO-Im. We also show that CDDO-Im blocks insulin-induced activation of this pathway by binding to mTOR and inhibiting its kinase activity.

A total of 20 million reads were obtained and mapped onto the known resistance gene sequences. As a result, a total of 9 classes, including 36 types of antibiotic resistant genes, were identified. Among these genes, 25 and 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) appeared, of which 9 and 12 SNPs are nonsynonymous substitutions in the E1 and E2 samples. It is interesting to find that a novel genotype of bla(KLUC), whose close relatives, bla(KLUC-1) and bla(KLUC-2), have been previously reported as carried on the Kluyvera cryocrescens chromosome and Enterobacter cloacae plasmid, was identified. It shares 99% and 98% amino acid identities with Kluc-1 and Kluc-2, respectively. Further PCR screening of 608 Enterobacteriaceae family isolates yielded a second variant (named bla(KLUC-4)). It was interesting to find that Kluc-3 showed resistance to several cephalosporins including cefotaxime, whereas bla(KLUC-4) did not show any resistance to the antibiotics tested. This may be due to a positively charged residue, Arg, replaced by a neutral residue, Leu, at position 167, which is located within an omega-loop.

22429482,2012,"There is evidence that age related changes in episodic memory are heterogeneous and result from diverse pathologies. To test this, we examined performance of healthy high-functioning younger (N=41, ages 18-60 y) and older (N=58, ages 61-83 y) individuals in tests of associative memory, logical memory and memory in executive and object-recognition domains. We compared their relationships to each other and to other cognitive functions, including, psychomotor speed and verbal and spatial working memory. Older individuals showed significantly greater reduction in an index of the ability to learn new associations (NAL) than for memory in executive and object-recognition domains. Age-related reduction in NAL and in logical memory was of similar severity, but the two measures showed only moderate correlation when age and other cognitive functions were controlled for. NAL shows an age-related pattern of change distinct from memory in executive and object-recognition domains and from logical (item) memory. We propose that in healthy well-functioning individuals, NAL taps processes which support binding of newly learned association in context of accumulating information, a key function of the hippocampus. NAL may thus serve as a selective marker of complex, hippocampus-based, cognitive functions in studies of normal cognitive aging and of its possible relationship to early dementia.",1,1,7,0,0

Does it matter that postmortem studies in PD have demonstrated that mixed protein-aggregate pathology is the rule and pure α-synucleinopathy the exception? Should we continue to pursue convergent biomarkers that are representative of the diverse whole of PD or subtype-specific, divergent biomarkers, present in some but absent in most?

Urinalysis and culture values were stratified as leukocyte esterase (0, or 1 or greater), nitrite (positive or negative), pyuria (fewer than 5, or 5 or greater white blood cells per high power field), cloudy urine (positive or negative) and urine culture bacterial growth (less than 50,000, or 50,000 or greater cfu/ml). PathoScope was used for next generation sequencing alignment, bacterial classification and microbial diversity characterization.
RESULTS:
Subjects with neuropathic bladder were significantly more likely to have positive leukocyte esterase and pyuria, cloudy urine and bacterial growth. Of 47 samples 23 showed bacterial growth on culture and in all samples bacteria were identified by pyrosequencing. Nonneuropathic bladder urine microbiomes included greater proportions of Lactobacillus crispatus in females and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in males. The Lactobacillus community differed significantly among females depending on bladder function. Irrespective of gender the subjects with neuropathic bladder had greater proportions of Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumonia. In 4 subjects with neuropathic bladder Actinobaculum sp. was detected by sequencing and by PathoScope but not by cultivation and in all cases it was associated with pyuria.
CONCLUSIONS:
Using PathoScope plus 16S pyrosequencing we were able to identify unique, phenotype dependent, species level microbes. Novel findings included absent L. crispatus in the urine of females with neuropathic bladder and the presence of Actinobaculum only in subjects with neuropathic bladder.

29549331,2018,"The development of non-genotoxic therapies that activate wild-type p53 in tumors is of great interest since the discovery of p53 as a tumor suppressor. Here we report the identification of over 100 small-molecules activating p53 in cells. We elucidate the mechanism of action of a chiral tetrahydroindazole (HZ00), and through target deconvolution, we deduce that its active enantiomer (R)-HZ00, inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). The chiral specificity of HZ05, a more potent analog, is revealed by the crystal structure of the (R)-HZ05/DHODH complex. Twelve other DHODH inhibitor chemotypes are detailed among the p53 activators, which identifies DHODH as a frequent target for structurally diverse compounds. We observe that HZ compounds accumulate cancer cells in S-phase, increase p53 synthesis, and synergize with an inhibitor of p53 degradation to reduce tumor growth in vivo. We, therefore, propose a strategy to promote cancer cell killing by p53 instead of its reversible cell cycle arresting effect.",1,0,1,0,0
11404013,2001,"The mammalian Sry on the short arm of the Y chromosome encodes a nuclear factor-like protein harboring a DNA-binding domain known as the HMG box. The Sox genes encode similar factor like proteins, but the sequence similarity of the HMG box to that of Sry is variable as being at least 60%. The functional relationship of Sox to Sry genes with special reference to sex determination is unclear except for a few items such as human autosomal Sox9. Thus, it is significant to know more about the evolutionary in addition to the functional relationship between Sry and Sox genes for deepening and broadening our understanding concerning primary sex determination. Therefore, to clarify the ancestry and molecular evolution of the mammalian sex determining gene Sry with its evolutionary relationships to the Sox gene, a molecular phylogenetic tree for the HMG box superfamily was constructed and analyzed, and the following conclusions were reached: (1) The nuclear non histone HMG proteins are supposedly the oldest, appearing at least more than one billion years ago, before the divergence of animals and plants. They diverged into two subgroups: one contains HMG14 and HMG17, and the other one contains HMG1 and HMG2 with various other genes. Subsequent divergences include the nucleolar UBF, nuclear SSRP as well as fungal mating protein Mc, MAT and Ste11. (2) The Sox and Sry genes diverged following the diversification of lymphoid transcription factors TCF and LEF. The Sry gene might have definitely evolved from the Sox gene cluster a few hundred million years ago. Additionally, the marsupial Sry, e.g. from Wallabie's and Dunnart's, is distinguished by being distant from eutherian Sry, but being closely related to the Sox gene cluster. (3) Molecular evolutionary rates estimated in mammalian Sry as the divergent rate per 100 million years are much higher than in Sox genes or other genes from the HMG box superfamily. This rapid evolution of Sry might agree with the fact that the Srys are present not on the pseudoautosomal region but on the distal region with no recombination of the Y chromosomal short arm.",1,1,4,0,0
22404039,2012,"The chromosomal translocation t(12;21) resulting in the ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene is the most frequent structural cytogenetic abnormality among patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We investigated 62 ETV6/RUNX1-positive childhood ALL patients by single nucleotide polymorphism array to explore acquired copy number alterations (CNAs) at diagnosis. The mean number of CNAs was 2·82 (range 0-14). Concordance with available G-band karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization was 93%. Based on three major protein-protein complexes disrupted by these CNAs, patients could be categorized into four distinct subgroups, defined by different underlying biological mechanisms relevant to the aetiology of childhood ALL. When recurrent CNAs were evaluated by an oncogenetic tree analysis classifying their sequential order, the most common genetic aberrations (deletions of 6q, 9p, 13q and X, and gains of 10 and 21) seemed independent of each other. Finally, we identified the most common regions with recurrent gains and losses, which comprise microRNA clusters with known oncogenic or tumour-suppressive roles. The present study sheds further light on the genetic diversity of ETV6/RUNX1-positive childhood ALL, which may be important for understanding poor responses among this otherwise highly curable subset of ALL and lead to novel targeted treatment strategies.",1,1,5,0,0
22445157,2012,"HIV-related stigmas have been seen as a barrier to greater religious congregation involvement in HIV prevention and care in the United States and elsewhere. We explored congregational and community norms and attitudes regarding HIV, sexuality, and drug use through a qualitative case study of 14 diverse religious congregations in Los Angeles County, California between December 2006 and May 2008. Data collected included semi-structured interviews with 57 clergy and lay leaders across the congregations, structured observations of congregational activities, review of archival documents, and a questionnaire on congregational characteristics. Across and within congregations, we found a wide range of views towards HIV, people with HIV, and populations at risk for HIV, from highly judgmental and exclusionary, to ""loving the sinner, not the sin,"" to accepting and affirming. Attitudes and norms about HIV, homosexuality, and substance abuse appeared to be related to the type and intensity of congregational HIV-related activities. However, even among the higher activity congregations, we found a range of perceptions, including ones that were stigmatizing. Results suggest that affirming norms and attitudes are not a prerequisite for a congregation to initiate HIV activities, a finding relevant for HIV service providers and researchers seeking to engage congregations on this issue. HIV stigma reduction is not a prerequisite for congregational HIV involvement: both may occur simultaneously, or one before the other, and they dynamically affect each other. Strategies that are congruent with congregations' current levels of comfort and openness around HIV can themselves facilitate a process of attitudinal and normative change.",1,1,2,0,1
18628465,2008,"OBJECTIVE:
Histone deacetylase inhibitors can alter gene expression and mediate diverse antitumor activities. Herein, we report the safety and activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and identify genes commonly regulated by panobinostat.
METHODS:
Panobinostat was administered orally to patients with CTCL on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week on a 28-day cycle. A dose of 30 mg was considered excessively toxic, and subsequent patients were treated at the expanded maximum tolerated dose of 20 mg. Biopsies from six patients taken 0, 4, 8, and 24 h after administration were subjected to microarray gene expression profiling and real-time quantitative PCR of selected genes.
RESULTS:
Patients attained a complete response (n = 2), attained a partial response (n = 4), achieved stable disease with ongoing improvement (n = 1), and progressed on treatment (n = 2). Microarray data showed distinct gene expression response profiles over time following panobinostat treatment, with the majority of genes being repressed. Twenty-three genes were commonly regulated by panobinostat in all patients tested.
CONCLUSIONS:
Panobinostat is well tolerated and induces clinical responses in CTCL patients. Microarray analyses of tumor samples indicate that panobinostat induces rapid changes in gene expression, and surprisingly more genes are repressed than are activated. A unique set of genes that can mediate biological responses such as apoptosis, immune regulation, and angiogenesis were commonly regulated in response to panobinostat. These genes are potential molecular biomarkers for panobinostat activity and are strong candidates for the future assessment of their functional role(s) in mediating the antitumor responses of panobinostat.

When suitably modified, Agrobacterium has become the most effective vector for gene transfer in plant biotechnology. However, the complexity of the patent landscape has created both real and perceived obstacles to the effective use of this technology for agricultural improvements by many public and private organizations worldwide. Here we show that several species of bacteria outside the Agrobacterium genus can be modified to mediate gene transfer to a number of diverse plants. These plant-associated symbiotic bacteria were made competent for gene transfer by acquisition of both a disarmed Ti plasmid and a suitable binary vector. This alternative to Agrobacterium-mediated technology for crop improvement, in addition to affording a versatile 'open source' platform for plant biotechnology, may lead to new uses of natural bacteria-plant interactions to achieve plant transformation.",1,0,1,0,0
25749621,2015,"Range shifts (especially during the Pleistocene), polyploidisation and hybridization are major factors affecting high-mountain biodiversity. A good system to study their role in the European high mountains is the Doronicum clusii aggregate (Asteraceae), whose four taxa (D. clusii s.s., D. stiriacum, D. glaciale subsp. glaciale and D. glaciale subsp. calcareum) are differentiated geographically, ecologically (basiphilous versus silicicolous) and/or via their ploidy levels (diploid versus tetraploid). Here, we use DNA sequences (three plastid and one nuclear spacer) and AFLP fingerprinting data generated for 58 populations to infer phylogenetic relationships, origin of polyploids-whose ploidy level was confirmed by chromosomally calibrated DNA ploidy level estimates-and phylogeographic history. Taxonomic conclusions were informed, among others, by a Gaussian clustering method for species delimitation using dominant multilocus data. Based on molecular data we identified three lineages: (i) silicicolous diploid D. clusii s.s. in the Alps, (ii) silicicolous tetraploid D. stiriacum in the eastern Alps (outside the range of D. clusii s.s.) and the Carpathians and (iii) the basiphilous diploids D. glaciale subsp. glaciale (eastern Alps) and D. glaciale subsp. calcareum (northeastern Alps); each taxon was identified as distinct by the Gaussian clustering, but the separation of D. glaciale subsp. calcareum and D. glaciale subsp. glaciale was not stable, supporting their taxonomic treatment as subspecies. Carpathian and Alpine populations of D. stiriacum were genetically differentiated suggesting phases of vicariance, probably during the Pleistocene. The origin (autopolyploid versus allopolyploid) of D. stiriacum remained unclear. Doronicum glaciale subsp. calcareum was genetically and morphologically weakly separated from D. glaciale subsp. glaciale but exhibited significantly higher genetic diversity and rarity. This suggests that the more widespread D. glaciale subsp. glaciale originated from D. glaciale subsp. calcareum, which is restricted to a prominent Pleistocene refugium previously identified in other alpine plant species.

20549940,2010,"Cancer is a complex multistep disease characterized by a profound genetic instability which leads to the aberrant and uncoordinated expression of several gene products, ultimately leading to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype. The identification of molecules and pathways that contribute to cancer establishment and progression has determined an enormous progress in oncology, providing new perspectives for the design of more specific and efficacious pharmacological approaches. In this picture, ion channels represent a relatively novel and unexpected player. In fact, the expression and activity of different channel types mark and regulate specific stages of cancer progression. The contribution of ion channels to the neoplastic phenotype ranges from the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis, to the regulation of invasiveness and metastatic spread. The role of ion channels in such processes can often be attributed to novel signaling mechanisms triggered and modulated by ion channel proteins, independently from ion fluxes. Ion channels encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene 1 (herg), hERG 1 channels, are often aberrantly expressed in many primary human cancers and exert pleiotropic effects in cancer cells. Some of them are strictly related to the modulation of adhesive interactions with the extracellular matrix. The latter in turn can either regulate cell differentiation, or improve cell motility and invasiveness or stimulate the process of neo-angiogenesis. hERG1 channels can induce such diverse effects since they trigger and modulate intracellular signaling cascades. This role often depends on the formation, on the plasma membrane of tumor cells, of macromolecular complexes with membrane receptors, especially integrins. The link between hERG1 and integrins is twofold: integrins, mainly the beta1 integrin subunit, can activate hERG1. Conversely, the channels, once activated by integrins, can modulate signaling pathways downstream to integrin receptors. Both effects are mediated by the formation of a hERG1/beta1 integrin complex. Based on current evidence, we hypothesize that the activity of hERG1 channels inside the complex modulates the function of the partner protein(s) mainly through conformational coupling, instead of alterations of ion flow. Moreover, the hERG1-centered plasma membrane complexes, being specific of cancer cells, could represent novel targets for antineoplastic therapy.",1,0,1,0,0
21907015,2011,"Anterior segment dysgenesis describes a group of heterogeneous developmental disorders that affect the anterior chamber of the eye and are associated with an increased risk of glaucoma.

These results highlight the diverse ocular phenotypes caused by PXDN mutations, which are likely due to differences in genetic background and environmental factors. Peroxidasin is an extracellular matrix-associated protein with peroxidase catalytic activity, and we confirmed localization of the protein to the cornea and lens epithelial layers. Our findings imply that peroxidasin is essential for normal development of the anterior chamber of the eye, where it may have a structural role in supporting cornea and lens architecture as well as an enzymatic role as an antioxidant enzyme in protecting the lens, trabecular meshwork, and cornea against oxidative damage.",1,0,1,0,2

28591222,2017,"Lamniform sharks are apex marine predators undergoing dramatic local and regional decline worldwide, with consequences for marine ecosystems that are difficult to predict. Through their long history, lamniform sharks have faced widespread extinction, and understanding those 'natural experiments' may help constrain predictions, placing the current crisis in evolutionary context. Here we show, using novel morphometric analyses of fossil shark teeth, that the end-Cretaceous extinction of many sharks had major ecological consequences. Post-extinction ecosystems supported lower diversity and disparity of lamniforms, and were dominated by significantly smaller sharks with slimmer, smoother and less robust teeth. Tooth shape is intimately associated with ecology, feeding and prey type, and by integrating data from extant sharks we show that latest Cretaceous sharks occupied similar niches to modern lamniforms, implying similar ecosystem structure and function. By comparison, species in the depauperate post-extinction community occupied niches most similar to those of juvenile sand tigers (Carcharias taurus). Our data show that quantitative tooth morphometrics can distinguish lamniform sharks due to dietary differences, providing critical insights into ecological consequences of past extinction episodes.",1,1,2,0,0
29623082,2018,"With the advent of checkpoint blockade therapies, immunotherapy is now a critical modality for the treatment of some cancers. While some patients respond well to checkpoint blockade, many do not, necessitating the need for other forms of therapy. Vaccination against malignancy has been a long sought goal of science. For cancers holding a microbial etiology, vaccination has been highly effective in reducing the incidence of disease. However, vaccination against established malignancy has been largely disappointing. In this review, we discuss efforts to develop diverse vaccine modalities in the treatment of cancer with a particular focus on melanoma. Recent work has suggested that vaccines targeting patient-specific tumor mutations may be more relevant than those targeting unmutated proteins. Nonetheless, tumor cells utilize many strategies to evade host immunity. It is likely that the full potential of cancer vaccination will only be realized when vaccines are combined with other therapies targeting tumor immunoevasive mechanisms.

28661810,2017,"OBJECTIVES:
To identify determinants of receipt of annual oral health examinations and self-rated oral health among diverse Asian American subgroups.
METHODS:
We used data from the Community Health Resources and Needs Assessment, a community-based survey of Asian American immigrant adults conducted in the New York City metropolitan region from 2013 to 2016 (n = 1288). We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess determinants of oral health care receipt and self-rated oral health.
RESULTS:
Failure to receive an annual oral health examination was common in this sample (41.5%) and was more frequent for participants who were younger and male and those who had poorer English fluency and lower educational attainment. Not having dental insurance versus having private dental insurance resulted in 2 to 3 times the odds of nonreceipt of oral health care and poor self-rated oral health.
CONCLUSIONS:
Nonreceipt of annual oral health examinations and poor self-rated oral health were common across Asian American subgroups. Facilitating dental insurance sign-up and providing in-language services may improve oral health care access and ultimately oral health among Asian American immigrants.

21364888,2011,"BACKGROUND:
The SMC5-6 protein complex is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. It is composed of 6-8 polypeptides, of which Nse1, Nse3 and Nse4 form a tight sub-complex. MAGEG1, the mammalian ortholog of Nse3, is the founding member of the MAGE (melanoma-associated antigen) protein family and Nse4 is related to the EID (E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation) family of transcriptional repressors.
RESULTS:
Using site-directed mutagenesis, protein-protein interaction analyses and molecular modelling, we have identified a conserved hydrophobic surface on the C-terminal domain of Nse3 that interacts with Nse4 and identified residues in its N-terminal domain that are essential for interaction with Nse1. We show that these interactions are conserved in the human orthologs. Furthermore, interaction of MAGEG1, the mammalian ortholog of Nse3, with NSE4b, one of the mammalian orthologs of Nse4, results in transcriptional co-activation of the nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1). In an examination of the evolutionary conservation of the Nse3-Nse4 interactions, we find that several MAGE proteins can interact with at least one of the NSE4/EID proteins.
CONCLUSIONS:
We have found that, despite the evolutionary diversification of the MAGE family, the characteristic hydrophobic surface shared by all MAGE proteins from yeast to humans mediates its binding to NSE4/EID proteins. Our work provides new insights into the interactions, evolution and functions of the enigmatic MAGE proteins.

Through a specific design with double-sides illumination, the space charge density can be reduced and the responsivity and saturation power can be improved significantly. The measured dark current, responsivity and bandwidth are 0.86 μA, 1.06 A/W and 36 GHz under 3 V reverse biased voltage, respectively.

24189773,2013,"OBJECTIVE:
Severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥35) is associated with a broad range of health risks. Bariatric surgery induces weight loss and short-term health improvements, but little is known about long-term outcomes of these operations.
OBJECTIVE:
To report 3-year change in weight and select health parameters after common bariatric surgical procedures.
METHODS:
The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) Consortium is a multicenter observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS AND EXPOSURE: Adults undergoing first-time bariatric surgical procedures as part of routine clinical care by participating surgeons were recruited between 2006 and 2009 and followed up until September 2012. Participants completed research assessments prior to surgery and 6 months, 12 months, and then annually after surgery.
METHODS:
Three years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), we assessed percent weight change from baseline and the percentage of participants with diabetes achieving hemoglobin A1c levels less than 6.5% or fasting plasma glucose values less than 126 mg/dL without pharmacologic therapy. Dyslipidemia and hypertension resolution at 3 years was also assessed.
RESULTS:
At baseline, participants (N = 2458) were 18 to 78 years old, 79% were women, median BMI was 45.9 (IQR, 41.7-51.5), and median weight was 129 kg (IQR, 115-147). For their first bariatric surgical procedure, 1738 participants underwent RYGB, 610 LAGB, and 110 other procedures. At baseline, 774 (33%) had diabetes, 1252 (63%) dyslipidemia, and 1601 (68%) hypertension. Three years after surgery, median actual weight loss for RYGB participants was 41 kg (IQR, 31-52), corresponding to a percentage of baseline weight lost of 31.5% (IQR, 24.6%-38.4%). For LAGB participants, actual weight loss was 20 kg (IQR, 10-29), corresponding to 15.9% (IQR, 7.9%-23.0%). The majority of weight loss was evident 1 year after surgery for both procedures. Five distinct weight change trajectory groups were identified for each procedure. Among participants who had diabetes at baseline, 216 RYGB participants (67.5%) and 28 LAGB participants (28.6%) experienced partial remission at 3 years. The incidence of diabetes was 0.9% after RYGB and 3.2% after LAGB. Dyslipidemia resolved in 237 RYGB participants (61.9%) and 39 LAGB participants (27.1%); remission of hypertension occurred in 269 RYGB participants (38.2%) and 43 LAGB participants (17.4%).
CONCLUSIONS:
Among participants with severe obesity, there was substantial weight loss 3 years after bariatric surgery, with the majority experiencing maximum weight change during the first year. However, there was variability in the amount and trajectories of weight loss and in diabetes, blood pressure, and lipid outcomes.

Populations in Europe are becoming increasingly ethnically diverse, and health risks differ between ethnic groups. The aim of the HELIUS (HEalthy LIfe in an Urban Setting) study is to unravel the mechanisms underlying the impact of ethnicity on communicable and non-communicable diseases.
METHODS:
HELIUS is a large-scale prospective cohort study being carried out in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The sample is made up of Amsterdam residents of Surinamese (with Afro-Caribbean Surinamese and South Asian-Surinamese as the main ethnic groups), Turkish, Moroccan, Ghanaian, and ethnic Dutch origin. HELIUS focuses on three disease categories: cardiovascular disease (including diabetes), mental health (depressive disorders and substance use disorders), and infectious diseases. The explanatory mechanisms being studied include genetic profile, culture, migration history, ethnic identity, socio-economic factors and discrimination. These might affect disease risks through specific risk factors including health-related behaviour and living and working conditions. Every five years, participants complete a standardized questionnaire and undergo a medical examination. Biological samples are obtained for diagnostic tests and storage. Participants' data are linked to morbidity and mortality registries. The aim is to recruit a minimum of 5,000 respondents per ethnic group, to a total of 30,000 participants.
CONCLUSIONS:
This paper describes the rationale, conceptual framework, and design and methods of the HELIUS study. HELIUS will contribute to an understanding of inequalities in health between ethnic groups and the mechanisms that link ethnicity to health in Europe.

We compared the six alpha-carbon coordinates of this motif from the crystal structures of these three phosphatases and found that they are superimposable with rms deviations ranging from 0.27 to 0.60 A. Remarkably, when these proteins were aligned by this motif a common core structure emerged, defined by five alpha-helices and 11 beta-strands comprising 155 residues having rms deviations ranging from 1.48 to 2.66 A. We used the superimposed structures to align the sequences within the common core, and a distant relationship was observed suggesting a common ancestor. The common core was used to align the sequences of several other proteins that share significant similarity to inositol monophosphate phosphatase, including proteins encoded by fungal qa-X and qutG, bacterial suhB and cysQ (identical to amtA), and yeast met22 (identical to hal2). Evolutionary comparison of the core sequences indicate that five distinct branches exist within this family. These proteins share metal-dependent/Li(+)-sensitive phosphomonoesterase activity, and each predicted tree branch exhibits unique substrate specificity. Thus, these proteins define an ancient structurally conserved family involved in diverse metabolic pathways including inositol signaling, gluconeogenesis, sulfate assimilation, and possibly quinone metabolism. Furthermore, we suggest that this protein family identifies candidate enzymes to account for both the therapeutic and toxic actions of Li+ as it is used in patients treated for manic depressive disease.",1,0,1,0,0

The studies of diverse CMV glycoprotein B (gB) and N (gN) genotype variants in transplanted children and adolescents are lacking. We analyzed the investment of gB and gN genotype variants in the HSCTed children and their relation to clinical complications and disease outcome. The cohort included forty two pediatric recipients of the HSCT. Patients positive for CMV DNAemia (24/42, 57.1%) were genotyped. The gB4 and gN1 genotype variants predominated and were evidenced in 7/18 (38.9%) and 9/19 (47.4%) patients, respectively. The graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) predominated in children with viremia (p < 0.05). Frequencies of the gB and gN genotypes contrasted those reported in recent studies. The GvHD scaled strongly with CMV reactivation whereas viral loads were uncorrelated to medical complications and treatment outcomes.",1,1,5,0,0
21991363,2011,"ABCG2 is one of three human ATP binding cassette transporters that are functionally capable of exporting a diverse range of substrates from cells. The physiological consequence of ABCG2 multidrug transport activity in leukaemia, and some solid tumours is the acquisition of cancer multidrug resistance. ABCG2 has a primary structure that infers that a minimal functional transporting unit would be a homodimer. Here we investigated the ability of a bimolecular fluorescence complementation approach to examine ABCG2 dimers, and to probe the role of individual amino acid substitutions in dimer formation. ABCG2 was tagged with fragments of venus fluorescent protein (vYFP), and this tagging did not perturb trafficking or function. Co-expression of two proteins bearing N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of YFP resulted in their association and detection of dimerization by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Point mutations in ABCG2 which may affect dimer formation were examined for alterations in the magnitude of fluorescence complementation signal. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) demonstrated specific ABCG2 dimer formation, but no changes in dimer formation, resulting from single amino acid substitutions, were detected by BiFC analysis.",1,0,1,0,0
33122770,2020,"Parent selection is the core of hybrid breeding. The breeding strategy involving the parental identification of superior open-pollinated progeny of Populous tomentosa germplasm resources can significantly improve the efficiency of parental matching. However, due to some factors such as loose powdering time and pollen competitiveness, the offspring derived from open-pollination families which do not undergo completely random mating. Although hybrid combinations based on the male identification method have a high combining ability, this method cannot easily cover the mating combinations of all male and female specimens in the germplasm bank. In addition, the performance of superior plants in open-pollinated families also affects the selection result. If the trait performance value is higher than the population average, then the special combining ability of the reconstructed hybrid combination may be overestimated. Obtaining a solution to the above problems is of great significance for improving the efficiency and accuracy of selecting hybrid parents of P. tomentosa. In this study, 24 pairs of SSR (Simple Sequence Repeats) molecular markers were used to analyze the genetic differentiation of P. tomentosa germplasm resources. The results showed that the genetic variation of the P. tomentosa population was derived from individuals within the provenance, indicating that high genetic diversity is preserved in provenances. The correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the special combining ability of planting height and diameter at breast height (dbh) of the 34 full-sib progeny population and the genetic distance between the parents. Then, the genetic distance between 18 female plants with high fertility and 68 male plants with large pollen quantity was analyzed using this correlation. Fifteen female parents and 12 male parents were screened out, and 52 hybrid combinations with high specific combining ability for growth traits were predicted. Furthermore, for the male parent identification of superior individual plants, we constructed the breeding parent population including 10 female parents and 5 male parents, generating 14 hybrid combinations with potentially high combining ability. The results of the hybridization test showed that the specific combining ability of plant height and dbh was significantly higher than the controlled pollination. Moreover, genetic distance and paternal identification can be used to rapidly and efficiently construct hybrid parent combinations and breeding parent populations.",1,1,11,0,0

The mechanisms of photoreceptor cell fate specification and differentiation have been extensively investigated in a variety of animal model systems, including human and non-human primates, rodents (mice and rats), chickens, frogs (Xenopus) and fish. It appears timely to discuss whether it is possible to synthesize the resulting information into a unified model applicable to all vertebrates. In this review we focus on several widely used experimental animal model systems to highlight differences in photoreceptor properties among species, the diversity of developmental strategies and solutions that vertebrates use to create retinas with photoreceptors that are adapted to the visual needs of their species, and the limitations of the methods currently available for the investigation of photoreceptor cell fate specification. Based on these considerations, we conclude that we are not yet ready to construct a unified model of photoreceptor cell fate specification in the developing vertebrate retina.",1,0,1,0,0
31624141,2019,"The sequelae of diabetes include microvascular complications such as diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which involves glucose-mediated renal injury associated with a disruption in mitochondrial metabolic agility, inflammation, and fibrosis. We explored the role of the innate immune complement component C5a, a potent mediator of inflammation, in the pathogenesis of DKD in clinical and experimental diabetes. Marked systemic elevation in C5a activity was demonstrated in patients with diabetes; conventional renoprotective agents did not therapeutically target this elevation. C5a and its receptor (C5aR1) were upregulated early in the disease process and prior to manifest kidney injury in several diverse rodent models of diabetes. Genetic deletion of C5aR1 in mice conferred protection against diabetes-induced renal injury. Transcriptomic profiling of kidney revealed diabetes-induced downregulation of pathways involved in mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. Interrogation of the lipidomics signature revealed abnormal cardiolipin remodeling in diabetic kidneys, a cardinal sign of disrupted mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics. In vivo delivery of an orally active inhibitor of C5aR1 (PMX53) reversed the phenotypic changes and normalized the renal mitochondrial fatty acid profile, cardiolipin remodeling, and citric acid cycle intermediates. In vitro exposure of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells to C5a led to altered mitochondrial respiratory function and reactive oxygen species generation. These experiments provide evidence for a pivotal role of the C5a/C5aR1 axis in propagating renal injury in the development of DKD by disrupting mitochondrial agility, thereby establishing a new immunometabolic signaling pathway in DKD.",1,0,1,0,0

31711120,2020,"Detailed mapping of genetic and environmental influences on the functional connectome is a crucial step toward developing intermediate phenotypes between genes and clinical diagnoses or cognitive abilities. We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two adult twin samples (Nos = 446 and 371) to quantify genetic and environmental influence on all pairwise functional connections between 264 brain regions (~35 000 functional connections). Nonshared environmental influence was high across the whole connectome. Approximately 14-22% of connections had nominally significant genetic influence in each sample, 4.6% were significant in both samples, and 1-2% had heritability estimates greater than 30%. Evidence of shared environmental influence was weak. Genetic influences on connections were distinct from genetic influences on a global summary measure of the connectome, network-based estimates of connectivity, and movement during the resting-state scan, as revealed by a novel connectome-wide bivariate genetic modeling procedure. The brain's genetic organization is diverse and not as one would expect based solely on structure evident in nongenetically informative data or lower resolution data. As follow-up, we make novel classifications of functional connections and examine highly localized connections with particularly strong genetic influence. This high-resolution genetic taxonomy of brain connectivity will be useful in understanding genetic influences on brain disorders.",1,1,2,0,0
16946656,2006,"METHODS:
Prospective, single-arm interventional cohort.
OBJECTIVE:
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty to treat symptomatic vertebral body compression fractures (VCFs).
BACKGROUND:
VCFs treated nonoperatively can diminish function and quality of life, and lead to chronic health effects. The short-term safety and effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty for symptomatic VCFs are well-documented, but long-term follow-up is needed.
METHODS:
A total of 155 elderly patients with symptomatic VCFs were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter treatment study of balloon kyphoplasty at 19 geographically diverse US centers. Outcomes included back pain severity, bedrest, and limited activities because of back pain, back disability score, and SF-36 Medical Outcomes Survey, at 7 days (visual analog scale only), and 1, 3, 12, and 24 months after treatment.
RESULTS:
Patients reported severe back pain (15/20 on visual analog scale) interfering with daily activities 90% of days per month before kyphoplasty. Physical functioning and quality of life were also markedly impaired. Statistically significant (P < 0.001) improvements occurred in all pain, functional, and mental health outcomes at the first follow-up after treatment and were maintained for 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS:
Elderly patients with symptomatic VCFs had rapid, significant, and sustained improvements in back pain, back function, and quality of life following balloon kyphoplasty.

8498624,1993,"OBJECTIVE:
Although several studies have reported short-term gains for drug-use prevention programs targeted at young adolescents, few have assessed the long-term effects of such programs. Such information is essential for judging how long prevention benefits last. This paper reports results over a 6-year period for a multisite randomized trial that achieved reductions in drug use during the junior high school years.
METHODS:
The 11-lesson curriculum, which was tested in 30 schools in eight highly diverse West Coast communities, focused on helping 7th and 8th grade students develop the motivation and skills to resist drugs. Schools were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. About 4000 students were assessed in grade 7 and six times thereafter through grade 12. Program effects were adjusted for pretest covariates and school effects.
RESULTS:
Once the lessons stopped, the program's effects on drug use stopped. Effects on cognitive risk factors persisted for a longer time (many through grade 10), but were not sufficient to produce corresponding reductions in use.
CONCLUSIONS:
It is unlikely that early prevention gains can be maintained without additional prevention efforts during high school. Future research is needed to develop and test such efforts.

Leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) has been shown to prevent or delay the development of diabetes. However, little research exists examining how other domains of PA (e.g., occupation based [OPA] and transportation based [TPA]) are associated with diabetes prevalence across diverse racial/ethnic groups. We examined associations between OPA, TPA, and LTPA and diabetes prevalence and whether associations differed by race/ethnicity.

7538250,1995,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen EBNA-1 is essential for viral genome maintenance in vitro and may be the only EBV protein expressed by the majority of latently infected cells in vivo. EBNA-1 may therefore be critical to the evasion of host immunity which allows persistent infection. EBNA-1 includes a polymorphic internal repeat domain of unknown significance and unique regions which mediate all known functional activities and which have hitherto been assumed to be conserved between strains. Monoclonal antibodies were generated using a construct based on EBNA-1 of the prototype B95-8 strain, deleted for the repeat domain. These antibodies showed a limited profile of recognition of EBNA-1 in common laboratory EBV+ cell lines by immunoprecipitation and immunostaining. The observed antigenic heterogeneity also extended to spontaneously transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) representing viral isolates circulating within US and UK populations. DNA fragments spanning the C-terminal unique domain of EBNA-1 from eleven spontaneous LCLs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction for sequencing, which directly demonstrated extensive and unexpected variability between diverse type 1 EBV isolates. The resulting polymorphism affects most of the putative MHC Class I binding epitopes which could be identified within this region using published sequence motifs, and influences MHC binding by variants of at least one such peptide in the processing mutant cell line T2. These findings could be related to the apparent lack of recognition of EBNA-1 by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",1,0,1,0,0
8692885,1996,"TRAF1 and TRAF2 form an oligomeric complex that associates with the cytoplasmic domains of various members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. TRAF2 action is required for activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB triggered by TNF and the CD40 ligand. Here we show that TRAF1 and TRAF2 interact with A20, a zinc finger protein, whose expression is induced by agents that activate NF-kappaB. Mutational analysis revealed that the N-terminal half of A20 interacts with the conserved C-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF1 and TRAF2. In cotransfection experiments, A20 blocked TRAF2-mediated NF-kappaB activation. A20 also inhibited TNF and IL-1-induced NF-kappaB activation, suggesting that it may inhibit NF-kappaB activation signaled by diverse stimuli. The ability of A20 to block NF-kappaB activation was mapped to its C-terminal zinc finger domain. Thus, A20 is composed of two functionally distinct domains, an N-terminal TRAF binding domain that recruits A20 to the TRAF2-TRAF1 complex and a C-terminal domain that mediates inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Our findings suggest a possible molecular mechanism that could explain A20's ability to negatively regulate its own TNF-inducible expression.",1,0,1,0,0
24294607,2013,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mediated by the presence of autoantibodies that bind to components of the neuromuscular junction, causing the symptoms of muscular weakness and fatigability. Like most autoimmune disorders, MG is a multifactorial, noninherited disease, though with an established genetic constituent. The heterogeneity observed in MG perplexes genetic analysis even more, as it occurs in various levels, including diverse autoantigens, thymus histopathology, and age at onset. In this context of distinct subgroups, a plethora of association studies, discussed in this review, have assessed the involvement of various HLA and non-HLA related loci in MG susceptibility, over the past five years. As expected, certain HLA alleles were strongly associated with MG. Many of the non-HLA genes, such as PTPN22 and CTLA-4, have been previously studied in MG and other autoimmune diseases and their association with MG has been reevaluated in more cohesive groups of patients. Moreover, novel risk or protective loci have been revealed, as in the case of TNIP1 and FOXP3. Although the majority of these results have been derived from candidate gene studies, the focal point of all recent genetic studies is the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted on early-onset MG patients.

18461164,2008,"BACKGROUND:
Uncertainty persists over the environmental effects of genetically-engineered crops that produce the insecticidal Cry proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). We performed meta-analyses on a modified public database to synthesize current knowledge about the effects of Bt cotton, maize and potato on the abundance and interactions of arthropod non-target functional guilds.
RESULTS:
We compared the abundance of predators, parasitoids, omnivores, detritivores and herbivores under scenarios in which neither, only the non-Bt crops, or both Bt and non-Bt crops received insecticide treatments. Predators were less abundant in Bt cotton compared to unsprayed non-Bt controls. As expected, fewer specialist parasitoids of the target pest occurred in Bt maize fields compared to unsprayed non-Bt controls, but no significant reduction was detected for other parasitoids. Numbers of predators and herbivores were higher in Bt crops compared to sprayed non-Bt controls, and type of insecticide influenced the magnitude of the difference. Omnivores and detritivores were more abundant in insecticide-treated controls and for the latter guild this was associated with reductions of their predators in sprayed non-Bt maize. No differences in abundance were found when both Bt and non-Bt crops were sprayed. Predator-to-prey ratios were unchanged by either Bt crops or the use of insecticides; ratios were higher in Bt maize relative to the sprayed non-Bt control.
CONCLUSIONS:
Overall, we find no uniform effects of Bt cotton, maize and potato on the functional guilds of non-target arthropods. Use of and type of insecticides influenced the magnitude and direction of effects; insecticde effects were much larger than those of Bt crops. These meta-analyses underscore the importance of using controls not only to isolate the effects of a Bt crop per se but also to reflect the replacement of existing agricultural practices. Results will provide researchers with information to design more robust experiments and will inform the decisions of diverse stakeholders regarding the safety of transgenic insecticidal crops.

11251249,2001,"Recently, colloidal carrier systems have been receiving much attention in the field of drug targeting because of their high loading capacity for drugs as well as their unique disposition characteristics in the body. This paper highlights the utility of polymeric micelles formed through the multimolecular assembly of block copolymers as novel core-shell typed colloidal carriers for drug and gene targeting. The process of micellization in aqueous milieu is described in detail based on differences in the driving force of core segregation, including hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic interaction, metal complexation, and hydrogen bonding of constituent block copolymers. The segregated core embedded in the hydrophilic palisade is shown to function as a reservoir for genes, enzymes, and a variety of drugs with diverse characteristics. Functionalization of the outer surface of the polymeric micelle to modify its physicochemical and biological properties is reviewed from the standpoint of designing micellar carrier systems for receptor-mediated drug delivery. Further, the distribution of polymeric micelles is described to demonstrate their long-circulating characteristics and significant tumor accumulation, emphasizing their promising utility in tumor-targeting therapy. As an important perspective on carrier systems based on polymeric micelles, their feasibility as non-viral gene vectors is also summarized in this review article.",1,0,1,0,0
1783297,1991,"Population geneticists make a distinction between sexual and asexual organisms depending on whether individuals inherit genes from one or two parents. When individual genes are considered, this distinction becomes less satisfactory for multicellular sexual organisms. Individual genes pass through numerous asexual mitotic cell divisions in the germline prior to meiosis and sexual recombination. The processes of mitotic mutation, mitotic crossing over, and mitotic gene conversion create genotypic diversity between diploid cells in the germline. Genes expressed in the germline whose products affect cell viability (such as many ""housekeeping"" enzymes) may be subjected to natural selection acting on this variability resulting in a non-Mendelian output of gametes. Such genes will be governed by the population genetics of the sexual/asexual life cycle rather than the conventional sexual/Mendelian life cycle. A model is developed to investigate some properties of the sexual/asexual life cycle. When appropriate parameter values were included in the model, it was found that mutation rates per locus per gamete may vary by a factor of up to 100 if selection acts in the germline. Sexual/asexual populations appear able to evolve to a genotype of higher fitness despite intervening genotypes of lower fitness, reducing the problems of underdominance and Wright's adaptive landscape encountered by purely sexual populations. As might be expected this ability is chiefly determined by the number of asexual mitotic cell divisions within the germline. The evolutionary consequences of ""housekeeping"" loci being governed by the dynamics of the sexual/asexual life cycle are considered.",1,1,10,0,0
28328806,2017,"BACKGROUND:
Craniosynostosis is a disorder characterized by premature fusion of cranial sutures with subsequent development of abnormal craniofacial contour associated with variable skeletal and extra-skeletal abnormalities. In this family syndromic type of craniosynostosis was recognized and the etiology behind diverse forms of deformities have been diagnosed.
UNASSIGNED:
The negative impact of the disorder on the child and his family is enormous. Particularly when the diagnosis is late and little can be done. Though counselling the family through discussing the whole picture of the disorder might lessens their concern.
UNASSIGNED:
Diagnosis is the corner stone of management. In this paper we aimed to sensitize pediatricians, physicians, and orthopedic surgeons concerning the necessity to recognize syndromic associations early on.
METHODS:
Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis are usually associated with a complexity of malformation complex. Craniofacial surgery can be of remarkable help if the diagnosis is made early. It requires a series of corrections to avoid intellectual disability and other neurological deficits.The timing of interventions is strongly correlated on the timing of diagnosis.
RESULTS:
The earliest the diagnoses, the much better the outcomes are. And consequently avert the psychological and the financial cost on the patient and his family.

26180252,2015,"BACKGROUND:
Animal and human adult studies indicate that long-term intake of trans fatty acids (TFAs) may be associated with weight gain. High intake of fast foods and snacks, which are rich in TFAs, is linked to overweight status among school-age children. However, the specific effects of TFAs in this population are unknown.
OBJECTIVE:
We examined whether serum TFAs, used as biomarkers of intake, are associated with faster weight gain and linear growth during school years.
METHODS:
We quantified TFAs by GLC in serum samples of 668 children aged 5-12 y at the time of recruitment into an ongoing cohort study performed in Bogota (Colombia) since 2006. Serum proportions of trans palmitoleic acid (16:1t), trans oleic acid (18:1t), trans linoleic acid (18:2t), and total TFAs were used as biomarkers of intake. Anthropometric characteristics were measured periodically for a median of 30 mo. Body mass index-for-age z scores (BAZs) and height-for-age z scores (HAZs) were calculated with the use of the WHO reference. We estimated mean changes in BAZs and HAZs over follow-up according to quartiles of each TFA at baseline by using mixed-effects regression models with restricted cubic splines.
RESULTS:
Proportions of trans palmitoleic acid, trans oleic acid, trans linoleic acid, and total TFAs (mean ± SD, % of total serum FAs), were 0.22 ± 0.06, 0.91 ± 0.37, 0.96 ± 0.27, and 2.10 ± 0.59, respectively. Serum TFAs were not associated with changes in BAZs and HAZs after adjusting for sex, baseline age, and socioeconomic status. In a subgroup analysis by sex, serum trans palmitoleic acid was positively associated with the estimated change in HAZs from ages 6 to 14 y in boys (with use of the first quartile as the reference, differences in HAZs for trans palmitoleic acid quartiles were 0.73, 0.53, and 0.70, P-trend = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS:
Proportions of serum TFAs, used as biomarkers of TFA intake, were not associated with weight gain in children aged 6-14 y in low- and middle-income populations in Bogota. The proportion of trans palmitoleic acid was positively associated with linear growth in boys. Longer follow-up and studies in diverse cohorts with wider ranges of TFA intake are warranted.

Cryoprotection is a function of exposure time × temperature × permeability for the chosen protectant and diffusion pathway length, as determined by specimen geometry, to provide sufficient dehydration whilst avoiding excessive chemical toxicity. We have developed an innovative method of vacuum infiltration vitrification (VIV) at 381 mm (15 in) Hg (50 kPa) that ensures the rapid (5 min), uniform permeation of Plant Vitrification Solution 2 (PVS2) cryoprotectant into plant embryos and their successful cryopreservation, as judged by regrowth in vitro. This method was validated on zygotic embryos/embryonic axes of three species (Carica papaya, Passiflora edulis and Laurus nobilis) up to 1.6 mg dry mass and 5.6 mm in length, with varying physiology (desiccation tolerances) and 80 °C variation in lipid thermal profiles, i.e., visco-elasticity properties, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Comparisons between the melting features of cryoprotected embryos and embryo regrowth indicated an optimal internal PVS2 concentration of about 60% of full strength. The physiological vigour of surviving embryos was directly related to the proportion of survivors. Compared with conventional vitrification, VIV-cryopreservation offered a ∼ 10-fold reduction in PVS2 exposure times, higher embryo viability and regrowth and greater effectiveness at two pre-treatment temperatures (0 °C and 25 °C).

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an alternate treatment option for recurrent C. difficile infection (RCDI) refractory to antibiotic therapy. It has recently been discussed favorably in the clinical and scientific communities and is receiving increasing public attention. However, short- and long-term health consequences of FMT remain a concern, as the effects of the transplanted microbiota on the patient remain unknown. To shed light on microbial events associated with RCDI and treatment by FMT, we performed fecal microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing of 14 pairs of healthy donors and RCDI patients treated successfully by FMT. Post-FMT patient and healthy donor samples collected up to one year after FMT were studied longitudinally, including one post-FMT patient with antibiotic-associated relapse three months after FMT. This analysis allowed us not only to confirm prior reports that RCDI is associated with reduced diversity and compositional changes in the fecal microbiota, but also to characterize previously undocumented post-FMT microbiota dynamics. Members of the Streptococcaceae, Enterococcaceae, or Enterobacteriaceae were significantly increased and putative butyrate producers, such as Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were significantly reduced in samples from RCDI patients before FMT as compared to post-FMT patient and healthy donor samples. RCDI patient samples showed more case-specific variations than post-FMT patient and healthy donor samples. However, none of the bacterial groups were invariably associated with RCDI or successful treatment by FMT. Overall microbiota compositions in post-FMT patients, specifically abundances of the above-mentioned Firmicutes, continued to change for at least 16 weeks after FMT, suggesting that full microbiota recovery from RCDI may take much longer than expected based on the disappearance of diarrheal symptoms immediately after FMT.

22761826,2012,"The Red Queen hypothesis can explain the maintenance of host and parasite diversity.

A European crustacean (Daphnia magna)--bacterium (Pasteuria ramosa) system typifies such specificity and high virulence. We studied the North American host Daphnia dentifera and its natural parasite Pasteuria ramosa, and also found strong genetic specificity for infection success and high virulence. These results suggest that Pasteuria could promote Red Queen dynamics with D. dentifera populations as well. However, the Red Queen might be undermined in this system by selection from a more common yeast parasite (Metschnikowia bicuspidata). Resistance to the yeast did not correlate with resistance to Pasteuria among host genotypes, suggesting that selection by Metschnikowia should proceed relatively independently of selection by Pasteuria.",1,0,1,0,2
31498844,2019,"In Southeast Asia, primary tropical rainforests are usually dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees belonging to Dipterocarpaceae, although arbuscular mycorrhizal trees often outcompete them after disturbances such as forest fires and clear-cutting, thus preventing dipterocarp regeneration. In some secondary tropical forests, however, potentially ECM trees belonging to Tristaniopsis (Myrtaceae) become dominant and may help ECM dipterocarp forests to recover. However, we have no information about their mycorrhizal status in these settings. In this study, we analyzed ECM fungal communities in tropical secondary forests dominated by Tristaniopsis and investigated which ECM fungal species are shared with other tropical or temperate areas. In total, 100 samples were collected from four secondary forests dominated by Tristaniopsis on Bangka Island. ECM tips in the soil samples were subjected to molecular analyses to identify both ECM and host species. Based on a >97% ITS sequence similarity threshold, we identified 56 ECM fungal species dominated by Thelephoraceae, Russulaceae, and Clavulinaceae. Some of the ECM fungal species were shared between dominant Tristaniopsis and coexisting Eucalyptus or Quercus trees, including 5 common to ECM fungi recorded in a primary mixed dipterocarp forest at Lambir Hill, Malaysia. In contrast, no ECM fungal species were shared with other geographical regions, even with Tristaniopsis in New Caledonia. These results imply that secondary tropical forests dominated by Tristaniopsis harbor diverse ECM fungi, including those that inhabit primary dipterocarp forests in the same geographical region. They may function as refugia for ECM fungi, given that dipterocarp forests are disappearing quickly due to human activity.",1,0,1,0,4

To address this question, we used multi-center resting-state fMRI data to explore the cross-cultural consistency and diversity of Broca's region in terms of its subdivisions, connectivity patterns and modularity organization in Chinese and German speakers. A consistent topological organization of the 13 subdivisions within the extended Broca's region was revealed on the basis of a new in-vivo parcellation map, which corresponded well to the previously reported receptorarchitectonic map. Based on this parcellation map, consistent functional connectivity patterns and modularity organization of these subdivisions were found. Some cultural difference in the functional connectivity patterns was also found, for instance stronger connectivity in Chinese subjects between area 6v2 and the motor hand area, as well as higher correlations between area 45p and middle frontal gyrus. Our study suggests that a generally invariant organization of Broca's region, together with certain regulations of different language experiences on functional connectivity, might exists to support language processing in human brain.",1,1,3,0,3
28973938,2017,"The diverse collections of microorganisms associated with humans and other animals, collectively referred to as their ""microbiome,"" are critical for host health, but the mechanisms that govern their assembly are poorly understood. This has made it difficult to identify consistent host factors that explain variation in microbiomes across hosts, despite large-scale sampling efforts. While ecological theory predicts that the movement, or dispersal, of individuals can have profound and predictable consequences on community assembly, its role in the assembly of animal-associated microbiomes remains underexplored. Here, we show that dispersal of microorganisms among hosts can contribute substantially to microbiome variation, and is able to overwhelm the effects of individual host factors, in an experimental test of ecological theory. We manipulated dispersal among wild-type and immune-deficient ",1,0,1,0,0
29718163,2018,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-inducible transcription factors that play critical roles in metazoan development, reproduction, and physiology and therefore are implicated in a broad range of pathologies. The transcriptional activity of NRs critically depends on their interaction(s) with transcriptional coregulator proteins, including coactivators and corepressors. Short leucine-rich peptide motifs in these proteins (LxxLL in coactivators and LxxxIxxxL in corepressors) are essential and sufficient for NR binding. With 350 different coregulator proteins identified to date and with many coregulators containing multiple interaction motifs, an enormous combinatorial potential is present for selective NR-mediated gene regulation. However, NR-coregulator interactions have often been determined experimentally on a one-to-one basis across diverse experimental conditions. In addition, NR-coregulator interactions are difficult to predict because the molecular determinants that govern specificity are not well established. Therefore, many biologically and clinically relevant NR-coregulator interactions may remain to be discovered. Here, we present a comprehensive overview of 3696 NR-coregulator interactions by systematically characterizing the binding of 24 nuclear receptors with 154 coregulator peptides. We identified unique ligand-dependent NR-coregulator interaction profiles for each NR, confirming many well-established NR-coregulator interactions. Hierarchical clustering based on the NR-coregulator interaction profiles largely recapitulates the classification of NR subfamilies based on the primary amino acid sequences of the ligand-binding domains, indicating that amino acid sequence is an important, although not the only, molecular determinant in directing and fine-tuning NR-coregulator interactions. This NR-coregulator peptide interactome provides an open data resource for future biological and clinical discovery as well as NR-based drug design.",1,0,1,0,0

Breast cancer accounts for the largest portion of cancer-related spending in the United States. Although hypofractionated radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery is a cost-effective and convenient treatment strategy for patients with early-stage breast cancer, less than 40% of eligible women received hypofractionated radiotherapy in 2013.
UNASSIGNED:
To assess the association of a large commercial payer's utilization management policy with the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy among women with early-stage breast cancer and its associated cost.
UNASSIGNED:
A retrospective, adjusted difference-in-differences economic analysis was conducted using administrative claims data from January 1, 2012, to June 1, 2018, of women 18 years or older with early-stage breast cancer who were eligible for hypofractionated radiotherapy according to 2011 guidelines from the American Society for Radiation Oncology and were continuously enrolled in 14 geographically diverse commercial health plans covering 6.9% of US adult women. Women who received mastectomy, brachytherapy, or less than 11 or more than 40 external beam fractions of radiotherapy were excluded. A utilization management policy was used to encourage the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy among women in fully insured and Medicare Advantage (fully insured) plans. Under the new policy, claims for extended-course radiotherapy were not reimbursed for fully insured women who were eligible for hypofractionated radiotherapy. This policy did not apply to women in self-insured or Medicare supplemental insurance (self-insured) plans, allowing these groups to serve as a comparison group.
UNASSIGNED:
The primary outcome was use of hypofractionated radiotherapy, and the secondary outcome was the cost of this type of radiotherapy.
UNASSIGNED:
Of 10 540 eligible women, 3619 (34.3%) were in fully insured plans and thus subject to the policy. There were no meaningful differences between the fully insured and self-insured groups in mean (SD) age at the start of radiotherapy (63.8 [8.6] vs 65.0 [8.9] years), mean (SD) Charlson Comorbidity Index score (3.0 [1.5] vs 3.2 [1.6]), or practice setting (outpatient hospital setting, 2982 of 3619 [82.4%] vs 5600 of 6921 [80.9%]). The policy was associated with an increase in use of hypofractionated radiotherapy among fully insured patients subject to the policy (adjusted percentage point difference-in-difference, 4.2%; 95% CI, 0.0%-8.4%; P = .05) and a nonsignificant decrease in radiotherapy-associated expenditures (-$2275 relative to self-insured patients; P = .09). Spillover analyses revealed a significantly higher uptake of hypofractionated radiotherapy among self-insured patients who were indirectly exposed to the policy (adjusted percentage point difference-in-difference, 8.5%; 95% CI, 3.6%-13.5%; P < .001) compared with those who were not exposed.
UNASSIGNED:
This study suggests that a payer's utilization management policy was associated with direct and spillover increases in the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy, even after accounting for a long-term secular trend in the uptake of hypofractionated radiotherapy in the control groups. Utilization management may promote evidence-based cancer care.

12874348,2003,"The Escherichia coli O26 serogroup includes important food-borne pathogens associated with human and animal diarrheal disease. Current typing methods have revealed great genetic heterogeneity within the O26 group; the data are often inconsistent and focus only on verotoxin (VT)-positive O26 isolates. To improve current understanding of diversity within this serogroup, the genomic relatedness of VT-positive and -negative O26 strains was assessed by comparative genomic indexing. Our results clearly demonstrate that irrespective of virulence characteristics and pathotype designation, the O26 strains show greater genomic similarity to each other than to any other strain included in this study. Our data suggest that enteropathogenic and VT-expressing E. coli O26 strains represent the same clonal lineage and that VT-expressing E. coli O26 strains have gained additional virulence characteristics.

31504041,2019,"HIV envelope protein (Env) is the sole target of broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) that are capable of neutralizing diverse strains of HIV. While BNAbs develop spontaneously in a subset of HIV-infected patients, efforts to design an envelope protein-based immunogen to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses have so far been unsuccessful. It is hypothesized that a primary barrier to eliciting BNAbs is the fact that HIV envelope proteins bind poorly to the germline-encoded unmutated common ancestor (UCA) precursors to BNAbs. To identify variant forms of Env with increased affinities for the UCA forms of BNAbs 4E10 and 10E8, which target the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER) of Env, libraries of randomly mutated Env variants were expressed in a yeast surface display system and screened using fluorescence activated cell sorting for cells displaying variants with enhanced abilities to bind the UCA antibodies. Based on analyses of individual clones obtained from the screen and on next-generation sequencing of sorted libraries, distinct but partially overlapping sets of amino acid substitutions conferring enhanced UCA antibody binding were identified. These were particularly enriched in substitutions of arginine for highly conserved tryptophan residues. The UCA-binding variants also generally exhibited enhanced binding to the mature forms of anti-MPER antibodies. Mapping of the identified substitutions into available structures of Env suggest that they may act by destabilizing both the initial pre-fusion conformation and the six-helix bundle involved in fusion of the viral and cell membranes, as well as providing new or expanded epitopes with increased accessibility for the UCA antibodies.",1,0,1,0,0

To evaluate the metabolic profile of Chilean and Argentinian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) according to the Rotterdam criteria.
METHODS:
Observational cross-sectional study.
METHODS:
Academic centers.
METHODS:
Women with PCOS, aged 18-39 years: 220 Chilean (PCOSCh) and 206 Argentinian (PCOSAr).
METHODS:
Physical examination, fasting blood samples for androgens, gonadotropins, metabolic parameters, and a transvaginal ultrasound.
METHODS:
Comparative analysis of the metabolic profile in both populations divided into four phenotypes.
RESULTS:
The distribution of the different phenotypes was different in both populations. PCOSCh women showed a higher body mass index and a higher percentage of metabolic syndrome in all phenotypes compared with the PCOSAr women. The PCOSAr women exhibited a statistically significantly higher diastolic blood pressure in phenotypes A, B, and C and a higher percentage of hypertension in phenotypes A and D compared with the PCOSCh women.
CONCLUSIONS:
The data show differences in the metabolic profile of both populations. PCOSCh women presented with greater metabolic alterations such as dysglycemia and dyslipidemia and a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, independent of the phenotype. The PCOSAr patients showed more elevated blood pressure. Ethnic diversity associated with environmental factors are fundamental elements in the analysis of the PCOS phenotypes.

However, the modulation of the transcriptional response to infection and the mechanism(s) of disease control are poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge of leprosy pathogenicity, we conducted a genome-wide search for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that are associated with transcript variation before and after stimulation with M. leprae sonicate in whole blood cells. We show that M. leprae antigen stimulation mainly triggered the upregulation of immune related genes and that a substantial proportion of the differential gene expression is genetically controlled. Indeed, using stringent criteria, we identified 318 genes displaying cis-eQTL at an FDR of 0.01, including 66 genes displaying response-eQTL (reQTL), i.e. cis-eQTL that showed significant evidence for interaction with the M. leprae stimulus. Such reQTL correspond to regulatory variations that affect the interaction between human whole blood cells and M. leprae sonicate and, thus, likely between the human host and M. leprae bacilli. We found that reQTL were significantly enriched among binding sites of transcription factors that are activated in response to infection, and that they were enriched among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with susceptibility to leprosy per se and Type-I Reaction, and seven of them have been targeted by recent positive selection. Our study suggested that natural selection shaped our genomic diversity to face pathogen exposure including M. leprae infection.",1,0,1,0,0
16701209,2006,"GABAB receptors are the G protein-coupled receptors for the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Molecular diversity in the GABAB system arises from the GABAB1a and GABAB1b subunit isoforms that solely differ in their ectodomains by a pair of sushi repeats that is unique to GABAB1a. Using a combined genetic, physiological, and morphological approach, we now demonstrate that GABAB1 isoforms localize to distinct synaptic sites and convey separate functions in vivo. At hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapses, GABAB1a assembles heteroreceptors inhibiting glutamate release, while predominantly GABAB1b mediates postsynaptic inhibition. Electron microscopy reveals a synaptic distribution of GABAB1 isoforms that agrees with the observed functional differences. Transfected CA3 neurons selectively express GABAB1a in distal axons, suggesting that the sushi repeats, a conserved protein interaction motif, specify heteroreceptor localization. The constitutive absence of GABAB1a but not GABAB1b results in impaired synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory, emphasizing molecular differences in synaptic GABAB functions.",1,0,1,0,0
30904868,2019,"OBJECTIVES:
To collate and systematically characterise the methods, results and clinical performance of the clinical risk prediction submissions to the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Data Analysis Challenge.
DESIGN:
Cross-sectional evaluation.
DATA SOURCES:
SPRINT Challenge online submission website.
STUDY SELECTION:
Submissions to the SPRINT Challenge for clinical prediction tools or clinical risk scores.
DATA EXTRACTION:
In duplicate by three independent reviewers.
RESULTS:
Of 143 submissions, 29 met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 23/29 (79%) reported prediction models for an efficacy outcome (20/23 [87%] of these used the SPRINT study primary composite outcome, 14/29 [48%] used a safety outcome, and 4/29 [14%] examined a combined safety/efficacy outcome). Age and cardiovascular disease history were the most common variables retained in 80% (12/15) of the efficacy and 60% (6/10) of the safety models. However, no two submissions included an identical list of variables intending to predict the same outcomes. Model performance measures, most commonly, the C-statistic, were reported in 57% (13/23) of efficacy and 64% (9/14) of safety model submissions. Only 2/29 (7%) models reported external validation. Nine of 29 (31%) submissions developed and provided evaluable risk prediction tools. Using two hypothetical vignettes, 67% (6/9) of the tools provided expected recommendations for a low-risk patient, while 44% (4/9) did for a high-risk patient. Only 2/29 (7%) of the clinical risk prediction submissions have been published to date.
CONCLUSIONS:
Despite use of the same data source, a diversity of approaches, methods and results was produced by the 29 SPRINT Challenge competition submissions for clinical risk prediction. Of the nine evaluable risk prediction tools, clinical performance was suboptimal. By collating an overview of the range of approaches taken, researchers may further optimise the development of risk prediction tools in SPRINT-eligible populations, and our findings may inform the conduct of future similar open science projects.

We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from 127 GFP-labeled SOM+ interneurons ('GIN') of the superficial cingulate cortex with subsequent biocytin-filling and immunocytochemical labeling. Principal component analysis followed by k-means clustering predicted two putative subtypes of SOM+ interneurons, which we designated as group I and group II GIN. A key finding of our study is the fact that these electrophysiologically and morphologically distinct groups of SOM+ interneurons can be correlated with two neurochemical subtypes of SOM+ interneurons described recently in our laboratory.

The cloned APRF protein is tyrosine phosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus in response to IL-6, but not in response to IFN-gamma. Tyrosine phosphorylation was also observed in response to other cytokines, such as leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, and ciliary neurotrophic factor, whose receptors share the IL-6 receptor signal transducer gp130. In contrast, we observed that p91 is not tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-6.

In the current study, the authors present a comprehensive genomic profile (CGP)-based study of advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) designed to detect clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGAs).
METHODS:
DNA was extracted from 40 µm of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 295 consecutive cases of recurrent/metastatic UC. CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 688X for all coding exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer, using process-matched normal control samples as a reference. CRGAs were defined as GAs linked to drugs on the market or currently under evaluation in mechanism-driven clinical trials.
RESULTS:
All 295 patients assessed were classified with high-grade (International Society of Urological Pathology classification) and advanced stage (stage III/IV American Joint Committee on Cancer) disease, and 294 of 295 patients (99.7%) had at least 1 GA on CGP with a mean of 6.4 GAs per UC (61% substitutions/insertions/deletions, 37% copy number alterations, and 2% fusions). Furthermore, 275 patients (93%) had at least 1 CRGA involving 75 individual genes with a mean of 2.6 CRGAs per UC. The most common CRGAs involved cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) (34%), fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) (21%), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) (20%), and ERBB2 (17%). FGFR3 GAs were diverse types and included 10% fusions. ERBB2 GAs were equally divided between amplifications and substitutions. ERBB2 substitutions were predominantly within the extracellular domain and were highly enriched in patients with micropapillary UC (38% of 32 cases vs 5% of 263 nonmicropapillary UC cases; P<.0001).
CONCLUSIONS:
Using a CGP assay capable of detecting all classes of GA simultaneously, an extraordinarily high frequency of CRGA was identified in a large series of patients with advanced UC. Cancer 2016;122:702-711. © 2015 American Cancer Society.

29547901,2018,"This study provides first insights into the involvement of hNOT/ALG3, the human counterpart of the Drosophila Neighbour of TID and yeast ALG3 gene, in various putative molecular networks. HNOT/ALG3 encodes two translated transcripts encoding precursor proteins differing in their N-terminus and showing 33% identity with the yeast asparagine-linked glycosylation 3 (ALG3) protein. Experimental evidence for the functional homology of the proteins of fly and man in the N-glycosylation has still to be provided. In this study, using the yeast two-hybrid technique we identify 17 molecular partners of hNOT-1/ALG3-1. We disclose the building of hNOT/ALG3 homodimers and provide experimental evidence for its in vivo interaction with the functionally linked proteins OSBP, OSBPL9 and LRP1, the SYPL1 protein and the transcription factor CREB3. Regarding the latter, we show that the 55 kDa N-glycosylated hNOT-1/ALG3-1 molecule binds the N-glycosylated CREB3 precursor but does not interact with CREB3's proteolytic products specific to the endoplasmic reticulum and to the nucleus. The interaction between the two partners is a prerequisite for the proteolytic activation of CREB3. In case of the further binding partners, our data suggest that hNOT-1/ALG3-1 interacts with both OSBPs and with their direct targets LRP1 and VAMP/VAP-A. Moreover, our results show that various partners of hNOT-1/ALG3-1 interact with its diverse post translationally processed products destined to distinct cellular compartments.

28792867,2017,"BACKGROUND:
The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strain used in the live attenuated influenza vaccine was changed for the 2015-2016 influenza season because of its lack of effectiveness in young children in 2013-2014. The Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network evaluated the effect of this change as part of its estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness in 2015-2016.
METHODS:
We enrolled patients 6 months of age or older who presented with acute respiratory illness at ambulatory care clinics in geographically diverse U.S. sites. Using a test-negative design, we estimated vaccine effectiveness as (1-OR)×100, in which OR is the odds ratio for testing positive for influenza virus among vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants. Separate estimates were calculated for the inactivated vaccines and the live attenuated vaccine.
RESULTS:
Among 6879 eligible participants, 1309 (19%) tested positive for influenza virus, predominantly for A(H1N1)pdm09 (11%) and influenza B (7%). The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against any influenza illness was 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41 to 55; P<0.001). Among children 2 to 17 years of age, the inactivated influenza vaccine was 60% effective (95% CI, 47 to 70; P<0.001), and the live attenuated vaccine was not observed to be effective (vaccine effectiveness, 5%; 95% CI, -47 to 39; P=0.80). Vaccine effectiveness against A(H1N1)pdm09 among children was 63% (95% CI, 45 to 75; P<0.001) for the inactivated vaccine, as compared with -19% (95% CI, -113 to 33; P=0.55) for the live attenuated vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS:
Influenza vaccines reduced the risk of influenza illness in 2015-2016. However, the live attenuated vaccine was found to be ineffective among children in a year with substantial inactivated vaccine effectiveness. Because the 2016-2017 A(H1N1)pdm09 strain used in the live attenuated vaccine was unchanged from 2015-2016, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made an interim recommendation not to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine for the 2016-2017 influenza season.

We analyzed mammary gland developmental responses to P and estrogen (E) in two strains of mice (BALB/c and C57BL/6) that exhibit differences in ductal development at sexual maturity and alveologenesis during pregnancy. C57BL/6 mice exhibited reduced proliferative and morphological responses to P. Analysis of known mediators of sidebranching and alveologenesis revealed that reduced P-induced expression of P receptor isoform B and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), as well as altered expression and regulation of cyclin D1, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta, and the downstream effectors of RANKL, nuclear Id2 and p21, contribute significantly to the reduced P responsiveness of the C57BL/6 mammary gland. In contrast, E responsiveness was greater in C57BL/6 than in BALB/c glands. E may play a compensatory role in C57BL/6 alveologenesis through its effect on the induction and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a, a known regulator of RANKL. These observations suggest that in human populations with heterogeneous genetic backgrounds, individuals may respond differentially to the same hormone.

S1P may also play an important role in cardiac development and ischemic preconditioning, but the mechanism underlying these effects is not known. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with SK1 as bait and a cardiac cDNA library to identify novel proteins involved in regulating SK1 activity in cardiomyocytes, we identified the LIM-only factor FHL2 (SLIM3) as a SK1-interacting protein in both yeast and mammalian cells. FHL2, but not FHL1 or FHL3, interacted with SK1, and FHL2 colocalized with SK1 in the cytoplasm. The interaction sites with SK1 consisted of at least 4 LIM domains in FHL2, whereas the C-terminal portion of SK1 mediates the binding of FHL2 in SK1. Overexpression of FHL2 attenuated the activity and antiapoptotic effects of SK1. Indeed, endothelin-1, which is a potent survival factor in cardiomyocytes, inhibited FHL2-SK1 association and increased SK1 activity. These findings indicate that FHL2 is a novel inhibitor of SK1 activity in cardiomyocytes and suggest that targeting FHL2 for inhibition may prevent myocardial apoptosis through activation of SK1.",1,0,1,0,0

A limitation to the anti-neoplastic efficacy of hPNPase(old-35) relates to its lack of cancer specificity. The promoter of Progression Elevated Gene-3 (PEG-Prom), discovered in our laboratory via subtraction hybridization in a transformation progression rodent tumor model functions selectively in a diverse array of human cancer cells, with limited activity in normal cells. An adenovirus constructed with the PEG-Prom driving expression of hPNPase(old-35) containing a C-terminal Hemaglutinin (HA)-tag (Ad.PEG.hPNPase(old-35)) was shown to induce robust transgene expression, growth suppression, apoptosis, and cell-cycle arrest in a broad panel of pancreatic cancer cells, with minimal effects in normal immortalized pancreatic cells. hPNPase(old-35) expression correlated with arrest in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle and up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) p21(CIP1/WAF-1/MDA-6) and p27(KIP1). In a nude mouse xenograft model, Ad.PEG.hPNPase(old-35) injections effectively inhibited growth of human pancreatic cancer cells in vivo.

Unfortunately, the Hadoop framework does not provide any built-in support for the most popular sequence file formats like FASTA or BAM. Moreover, the development of these routines is not easy, both because of the diversity of these formats and the need for managing efficiently sequence datasets that may count up to billions of characters. We present FASTdoop, a generic Hadoop library for the management of FASTA and FASTQ files. We show that, with respect to analogous input management routines that have appeared in the Literature, it offers versatility and efficiency. That is, it can handle collections of reads, with or without quality scores, as well as long genomic sequences while the existing routines concentrate mainly on NGS sequence data.

In this systematic review, we provide an overview of the literature on depression among Asian-Americans and explore the possible variations in depression prevalence estimates by methodological and demographic factors.
METHODS:
Six databases were used to identify studies reporting a prevalence estimate for depression in Asian-American adults in non-clinical settings. Meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled estimates of rates of depression by assessment type. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed for subgroup analyses by gender, age, ethnicity, and other participant characteristics.
RESULTS:
A total of 58 studies met the review criteria (n = 21.731 Asian-American adults). Heterogeneity across the studies was considerably high. The prevalence of major depression assessed via standardized clinical interviews ranged between 4.5% and 11.3%. Meta-analyses revealed comparable estimated prevalence rates of depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (35.6%, 95% CI 27.6%-43.7%) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (33.1%, 95% CI 14.9%-51.3%). Estimates varied by Asian racial/ethnic group and other participant characteristics. Estimates of depression among special populations, which included maternity, caregivers, and homosexuals, were significantly higher than estimates obtained from other samples (58.8% vs 29.3%, p = .003). Estimates of depression among Korean and Filipino-Americans were similar (33.3%-34.4%); however, the estimates were twice as high as those for Chinese-Americans (15.7%; p = .012 for Korean, p = .049 for Filipino).
CONCLUSIONS:
There appears to be wide variability in the prevalence rates of depression among Asian-Americans in the US. Practitioners and researchers who serve Asian-American adults need to be sensitive to the potential diversity of the expression of depression and treatment-seeking across Asian-American subgroups. Public health policies to increase Asian-American access to mental health care, including increased screening, are necessary. Further work is needed to determine whether strategies to reduce depression among specific Asian racial/ethnic groups is warranted.

23913973,2013,"Cancers adopt diverse strategies to safeguard their survival, which often involve blinding or incapacitating the immune response, thereby gaining battleground advantage against the host. In immune responses against cancer, an important stimulatory lymphocyte receptor is NKG2D because the tumor-associated expression of its ligands promotes destruction of malignant cells. However, with advanced human cancers profound changes unfold wherein NKG2D and its ligands are targeted or exploited for immune evasion and suppression. This negative imprinting on the immune system may be accompanied by another functional state wherein cancer cells coopt expression of NKG2D to complement the presence of its ligands for self-stimulation of tumor growth and presumably malignant progression. This review emphasizes these conflicting functional dynamics at the immunity-cancer biology interface in humans, within an overview of the immunobiology of NKG2D and mechanisms underlying the regulation of its ligands in cancer, with reference to instructive clinical observations and translational approaches.

31780680,2019,"Phlebotomine sand flies are remarkable vectors of several etiologic agents (virus, bacterial, trypanosomatid Leishmania), posing a heavy health burden for human populations mainly located at developing countries. Their intestinal microbiota is involved in a wide range of biological and physiological processes, and could exclude or facilitate such transmission of pathogens. In this study, we investigated the Eubacterial microbiome from digestive tracts of Lu. evansi adults structure using 16S rRNA gene sequence amplicon high throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) obtained from digestive tracts of Lu. evansi adults. The samples were collected at two locations with high incidence of the disease in humans: peri-urban and forest ecosystems from the department of Sucre, Colombia. 289,068 quality-filtered reads of V4 region of 16S rRNA gene were obtained and clustered into 1,762 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% similarity. Regarding eubacterial diversity, 14 bacterial phyla and 2 new candidate phyla were found to be consistently associated with the gut microbiome content. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in all the samples and the core microbiome was particularly dominated by Methylobacterium genus. Methylobacterium species, are known to have mutualistic relationships with some plants and are involved in shaping the microbial community in the phyllosphere. As a remarkable feature, OTUs classified as Wolbachia spp. were found abundant on peri-urban ecosystem samples, in adult male (OTUs n = 776) and unfed female (OTUs n = 324). Furthermore, our results provide evidence of OTUs classified as Cardinium endosymbiont in relative abundance, notably higher with respect to Wolbachia. The variation in insect gut microbiota may be determined by the environment as also for the type of feeding. Our findings increase the richness of the microbiota associated with Lu. evansi. In this study, OTUs of Methylobacterium found in Lu. evansi was higher in engorged females, suggesting that there are interactions between microbes from plant sources, blood nutrients and the parasites they transmit during the blood intake.",1,1,5,0,1
20807775,2010,"The duplication architecture of the human genome predisposes our species to recurrent copy number variation and disease. Emerging data suggest that this mechanism of mutation contributes to both common and rare diseases. Two features regarding this form of mutation have emerged. First, common structural polymorphisms create susceptible and protective chromosomal architectures. These structural polymorphisms occur at varying frequencies in populations, leading to different susceptibility and ethnic predilection. Second, a subset of rearrangements shows extreme variability in expressivity. We propose that two types of genomic disorders may be distinguished: syndromic forms where the phenotypic features are largely invariant and those where the same molecular lesion associates with a diverse set of diagnoses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability and congenital malformations. Copy number variation analyses of patient genomes reveal that disease type and severity may be explained by the occurrence of additional rare events and their inheritance within families. We propose that the overall burden of copy number variants creates differing sensitized backgrounds during development leading to different thresholds and disease outcomes. We suggest that the accumulation of multiple high-penetrant alleles of low frequency may serve as a more general model for complex genetic diseases, posing a significant challenge for diagnostics and disease management.",1,1,3,1,1
30079758,2019,"RATIONALE:
Characterization of patterns of wheezing and allergic sensitization in early life may allow for identification of specific environmental exposures impacting asthma development.
OBJECTIVES:
To define respiratory phenotypes in inner-city children and their associations with early-life environmental exposures.
METHODS:
Data were collected prospectively from 442 children in the URECA (Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma) birth cohort through age 7 years, reflecting symptoms (wheezing), aeroallergen sensitization, pulmonary function, and body mass index. Latent class mixed models identified trajectories of wheezing, allergic sensitization, and pulmonary function. Cluster analysis defined nonoverlapping groups (termed phenotypes). Potential associations between phenotypes and early-life environmental exposures were examined.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
Five phenotypes were identified and mainly differentiated by patterns of wheezing and allergic sensitization (low wheeze/low atopy; low wheeze/high atopy; transient wheeze/low atopy; high wheeze/low atopy; high wheeze/high atopy). Asthma was most often present in the high-wheeze phenotypes, with greatest respiratory morbidity among children with frequent wheezing and allergic sensitization. These phenotypes differentially related to early-life exposures, including maternal stress and depression, antenatal environmental tobacco smoke, house dust microbiome, and allergen content (all P < 0.05). Prenatal smoke exposure, maternal stress, and depression were highest in the high-wheeze/low-atopy phenotype. The high-wheeze/high-atopy phenotype was associated with low household microbial richness and diversity. Early-life aeroallergen exposure was low in high-wheeze phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS:
Patterns of wheezing, allergic sensitization, and lung function identified five respiratory phenotypes among inner-city children. Early-life environmental exposure to stress, depression, tobacco smoke, and indoor allergens and microbes differentially associate with specific phenotypes.

8612425,1996,"OBJECTIVE:
To analyze the status of the teaching of critical care at the postgraduate and undergraduate levels in Europe.
METHODS:
Two types of questionnaires were sent in order to collect data. The first questionnaire was sent to the heads of the intensive care units (ICUs) of at least five of the major hospitals in each western country of the European Region of the World Health Organization and to the people responsible for specialist training in the Eastern countries. Countries in the former USSR and former Yugoslavia were excluded; 50 questionnaires (of 105) were returned. The second questionnaire was sent to the 374 medical schools in the European Region; 253 were returned although only 185 were selected for this article.
RESULTS:
Postgraduate and undergraduate training differ widely in terms of the content of, and disciplines in charge of, the teaching of critical care. Even countries of the World Health Organization's European Region, where critical care is a recognized clinical specialty, do not have an academic discipline of critical care. This lack of an established academic discipline of critical care contributes to the diversity in teaching critical care in medical schools in the countries we studied. Postgraduate training is more formally regulated, and objectives and guidelines have been established in many countries. The topics in medical schools that correspond to critical care medicine do not encompass a distinct body of knowledge and are distributed among more traditional disciplines, most frequently internal medicine, anesthesiology, and surgery. The critical care medicine experience afforded to undergraduates varies widely between and within countries. The repetition of critical care conditions for which patients receive critical care in several disciplines, as described by the responses, leads us to wonder whether these conditions are really included in the curriculum.
CONCLUSIONS:
The standardization of curriculum content on critical care medicine, the clear definition of competence (the combination of knowledge, attitudes, skills, and judgment necessary to practice) in medical schools, and better coordinated postgraduate training are needed to clarify an educational approach in the field. Practitioners of critical care medicine will have to participate actively on curriculum committees. The recognition of critical care medicine as a specialty or subspecialty and as an academic discipline will facilitate the achievement of a comprehensive critical care education program.

31371740,2019,"Carex buekii is a tall sedge, forming large stands in wetlands, particularly in river floodplains across Central Europe and thus on many sites determining the typical appearance of riverine habitats. Our paper aims at increasing the knowledge on ecology of C. buekii and its role in the wetlands. Field data were collected in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Italy. Carex buekii usually occurs in nutrient rich habitats, but is also capable of colonising relatively nutrient-poor ones; it grows on both acidic and alkaline soils (pH 3.3-7.4) with diverse concentrations of assimilable elements (Ca, Mg, P, K). One of the most important ecological characteristics of C. buekii is its relationship to the floodplains of watercourses. It seems to be dependent on, or at least very tolerant to regular disturbances by streaming, floods and transport of sediments. Carex buekii usually forms relatively uniform stands of its own association, Caricetum buekii. The species most frequently accompanying C. buekii are Urtica dioica, Calystegia sepium, Galium aparine, Rubus caesius, Phalaris arundinacea, and Cirsium arvense. The sedge also occurs in the understorey of forests with e.g. Alnus glutinosa, Salix fragilis, Padus avium, and Quercus robur. Carex buekii is able to colonise man-made or man-changed habitats such as railway embankments and roadsides or regulated river banks. Taking into account the IUCN Red List Criteria we propose to regard C. buekii as a least-concern (LC).",1,1,3,0,10
19104035,2008,"The forcibly launched spores of ascomycete fungi must eject through several millimeters of nearly still air surrounding fruiting bodies to reach dispersive air flows. Because of their microscopic size, spores experience great fluid drag, and although this drag can aid transport by slowing sedimentation out of dispersive air flows, it also causes spores to decelerate rapidly after launch. We hypothesize that spores are shaped to maximize their range in the nearly still air surrounding fruiting bodies. To test this hypothesis we numerically calculate optimal spore shapes-shapes of minimum drag for prescribed volumes-and compare these shapes with real spore shapes taken from a phylogeny of >100 species. Our analysis shows that spores are constrained to remain within 1% of the minimum possible drag for their size. From the spore shapes we predict the speed of spore launch, and confirm this prediction through high-speed imaging of ejection in Neurospora tetrasperma. By reconstructing the evolutionary history of spore shapes within a single ascomycete family we measure the relative contributions of drag minimization and other shape determinants to spore shape evolution. Our study uses biomechanical optimization as an organizing principle for explaining shape in a mega-diverse group of species and provides a framework for future measurements of the forces of selection toward physical optima.",1,0,1,0,0
25902534,2015,"Attempts to understand mechanisms underlying plant mortality during drought have led to the emergence of a hydraulic framework describing distinct hydraulic strategies among coexisting species. This framework distinguishes species that rapidly decrease stomatal conductance (gs), thereby maintaining high water potential (Px; isohydric), from those species that maintain relatively high gs at low Px, thereby maintaining carbon assimilation, albeit at the cost of loss of hydraulic conductivity (anisohydric). This framework is yet to be tested in biodiverse communities, potentially due to a lack of standardized reference values upon which hydraulic strategies can be defined. We developed a system of quantifying hydraulic strategy using indices from vulnerability curves and stomatal dehydration response curves and tested it in a speciose community from South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. Degree of stomatal regulation over cavitation was defined as the margin between Px at stomatal closure (Pg12) and Px at 50% loss of conductivity. To assess relationships between hydraulic strategy and mortality mechanisms, we developed proxies for carbon limitation and hydraulic failure using time since Pg12 and loss of conductivity at minimum seasonal Px, respectively. Our approach captured continuous variation along an isohydry/anisohydry axis and showed that this variation was linearly related to xylem safety margin. Degree of isohydry/anisohydry was associated with contrasting predictions for mortality during drought. Merging stomatal regulation strategies that represent an index of water use behavior with xylem vulnerability facilitates a more comprehensive framework with which to characterize plant response to drought, thus opening up an avenue for predicting the response of diverse communities to future droughts.

UNASSIGNED:
The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort is a community-based study examining psychopathology, neurocognition, and neuroimaging among participants recruited through the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia pediatric network. Participants are youths aged 8 to 21 years at enrollment with stable health and fluency in English. The sample of 9498 participants was racially (5298 European ancestry [55.8%], 3124 African ancestry [32.9%], and 1076 other [11.4%]) and economically diverse. A randomly selected subsample (n = 1601) underwent multimodal neuroimaging. Data were collected from November 5, 2009, through December 30, 2011, and analyzed from February 1 through November 7, 2018.
UNASSIGNED:
The following domains were examined: (1) clinical, including psychopathology, assessed with a structured interview based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, and puberty, assessed with the Tanner scale; (2) neurocognition, assessed by the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery; and (3) multimodal magnetic resonance imaging parameters of brain structure and function.
UNASSIGNED:
A total of 9498 participants were included in the analysis (4906 [51.7%] female; mean [SD] age, 14.2 [3.7] years). Clinically, L-SES and TSEs were associated with greater severity of psychiatric symptoms across the psychopathology domains of anxiety/depression, fear, externalizing behavior, and the psychosis spectrum. Low SES showed small effect sizes (highest for externalizing behavior, 0.306 SD; 95% CI, 0.269 to 0.342), whereas TSEs had large effect sizes, with the highest in females for anxiety/depression (1.228 SD; 95% CI, 1.156 to 1.300) and in males for the psychosis spectrum (1.099 SD; 95% CI, 1.032 to 1.166). Both were associated with early puberty. Cognitively, L-SES had moderate effect sizes on poorer performance, the greatest being on complex cognition (-0.500 SD 95% CI, -0.536 to -0.464), whereas TSEs were associated with slightly better memory (0.129 SD; 95% CI, 0.084 to 0.174) and poorer complex reasoning (-0.109 SD; 95% CI, -0.154 to -0.064). Environmental factors had common and distinct associations with brain structure and function. Structurally, both were associated with lower volume, but L-SES had correspondingly lower gray matter density, whereas TSEs were associated with higher gray matter density. Functionally, both were associated with lower regional cerebral blood flow and coherence and with accelerated brain maturation.
UNASSIGNED:
Low SES and TSEs are associated with common and unique differences in symptoms, neurocognition, and structural and functional brain parameters. Both environmental factors are associated with earlier completion of puberty by physical features and brain parameters. These findings appear to underscore the need for identifying and preventing adverse environmental conditions associated with neurodevelopment.

To evaluate the results of large clinical trials vs the pooled results of smaller trials.
METHODS:
Meta-analyses with at least 1 ""large"" study were identified from the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Database and from MEDLINE (1966-1995).
METHODS:
We used a sample size approach to select 79 meta-analyses with at least 1 large study of 1000 or more patients. We used a statistical power approach to select 61 meta-analyses with at least 1 large study based on statistical power considerations.
METHODS:
The outcome of interest for each meta-analysis was the primary one stated in the original publication or, when not clearly specified, was decided on clinically.
RESULTS:
By random effects calculations, we found agreement between large and smaller trials in 90% of the meta-analyses selected by the sample size approach and in 82% of the meta-analyses selected by the statistical power approach. Twice as many disagreements appeared when the variability among large studies and among smaller studies was not considered (ie, fixed effects calculations). Of the 15 disagreements between results of large and smaller trials using the random effects model, plausible explanations were identified in 10 meta-analyses: 5 with differences in the control rate of events between large and smaller trials, 4 with specific protocol or study differences, and 1 with potential publication bias. Two other disagreements were not clinically important, and tentative reasons could be identified for 2 of the remaining 3 disagreements.
CONCLUSIONS:
Results of smaller studies are usually compatible with the results of large studies, but discrepancies do occur even when the diversity among both large studies and smaller studies is considered. Clinically important differences without a potential explanation are extremely uncommon. Future research should further examine sources of heterogeneity between the results of large and smaller trials.

16217547,2005,"Sequence diversity and gene content distinguish most isolates of Helicobacter pylori. Even greater sequence differences differentiate distinct populations of H. pylori from different continents, but it was not clear whether these populations also differ in gene content. To address this question, we tested 56 globally representative strains of H. pylori and four strains of Helicobacter acinonychis with whole genome microarrays. Of the weighted average of 1,531 genes present in the two sequenced genomes, 25% are absent in at least one strain of H. pylori and 21% were absent or variable in H. acinonychis. We extrapolate that the core genome present in all isolates of H. pylori contains 1,111 genes. Variable genes tend to be small and possess unusual GC content; many of them have probably been imported by horizontal gene transfer. Phylogenetic trees based on the microarray data differ from those based on sequences of seven genes from the core genome. These discrepancies are due to homoplasies resulting from independent gene loss by deletion or recombination in multiple strains, which distort phylogenetic patterns. The patterns of these discrepancies versus population structure allow a reconstruction of the timing of the acquisition of variable genes within this species. Variable genes that are located within the cag pathogenicity island were apparently first acquired en bloc after speciation. In contrast, most other variable genes are of unknown function or encode restriction/modification enzymes, transposases, or outer membrane proteins. These seem to have been acquired prior to speciation of H. pylori and were subsequently lost by convergent evolution within individual strains. Thus, the use of microarrays can reveal patterns of gene gain or loss when examined within a phylogenetic context that is based on sequences of core genes.",1,0,1,0,0
20668556,2010,"BACKGROUND:
In recent years, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis has emerged as a critical model organism for comparative genomics and developmental biology. Although Nematostella is a member of the anthozoan cnidarians (known for producing an abundance of diverse fluorescent proteins (FPs)), endogenous patterns of Nematostella fluorescence have not been described and putative FPs encoded by the genome have not been characterized.
RESULTS:
We described the spatiotemporal expression of endogenous red fluorescence during Nematostella development. Spatially, there are two patterns of red fluorescence, both restricted to the oral endoderm in developing polyps. One pattern is found in long fluorescent domains associated with the eight mesenteries and the other is found in short fluorescent domains situated between tentacles. Temporally, the long domains appear simultaneously at the 12-tentacle stage. In contrast, the short domains arise progressively between the 12- and 16-tentacle stage. To determine the source of the red fluorescence, we used bioinformatic approaches to identify all possible putative Nematostella FPs and a Drosophila S2 cell culture assay to validate NvFP-7R, a novel red fluorescent protein. We report that both the mRNA expression pattern and spectral signature of purified NvFP-7R closely match that of the endogenous red fluorescence. Strikingly, the red fluorescent pattern of NvFP-7R exhibits asymmetric expression along the directive axis, indicating that the nvfp-7r locus senses the positional information of the body plan. At the tissue level, NvFP-7R exhibits an unexpected subcellular localization and a complex complementary expression pattern in apposed epithelia sheets comprising each endodermal mesentery.
CONCLUSIONS:
These experiments not only identify NvFP-7R as a novel red fluorescent protein that could be employed as a research tool; they also uncover an unexpected spatio-temporal complexity of gene expression in an adult cnidarian. Perhaps most importantly, our results define Nematostella as a new model organism for understanding the biological function of fluorescent proteins in vivo.

21289227,2011,"OBJECTIVE:
To examine whether lower serum levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin (OH) D [25(OH)D] are associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
METHODS:
A post hoc analysis of three nested case-control studies of fractures, colon cancer, and breast cancer that measured serum 25(OH)D levels in women participating in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trials and Observational Study who were free of prevalent diabetes at baseline. Diabetes was defined as self-report of physician diagnosis or receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication. We used inverse probability weighting to make the study population representative of the WHI population as a whole. Weighted logistic regression models compared 25(OH)D levels (divided into quartiles, clinical cut points [<50, 50-<75, ≥ 75 nmol/L], or as a continuous variable) using the distribution of control subjects and adjusted for multiple confounding factors.
RESULTS:
Of 5,140 women (mean age 66 years) followed for an average of 7.3 years, 317 (6.2%) developed diabetes. Regardless of the cut points used or as a continuous variable, 25(OH)D levels were not associated with diabetes incidence in either age or fully adjusted models. Nor was any relationship found between 25(OH)D and incident diabetes when evaluated by strata of BMI, race/ethnicity, or randomization status in the Calcium Vitamin D trial.

24349405,2013,"Habitat fragmentation caused by human activities alters metapopulation dynamics and decreases biological connectivity through reduced migration and gene flow, leading to lowered levels of population genetic diversity and to local extinctions. The threatened Yarra pygmy perch, Nannoperca obscura, is a poor disperser found in small, isolated populations in wetlands and streams of southeastern Australia. Modifications to natural flow regimes in anthropogenically-impacted river systems have recently reduced the amount of habitat for this species and likely further limited its opportunity to disperse. We employed highly resolving microsatellite DNA markers to assess genetic variation, population structure and the spatial scale that dispersal takes place across the distribution of this freshwater fish and used this information to identify conservation units for management. The levels of genetic variation found for N. obscura are amongst the lowest reported for a fish species (mean heterozygosity of 0.318 and mean allelic richness of 1.92). We identified very strong population genetic structure, nil to little evidence of recent migration among demes and a minimum of 11 units for conservation management, hierarchically nested within four major genetic lineages. A combination of spatial analytical methods revealed hierarchical genetic structure corresponding with catchment boundaries and also demonstrated significant isolation by riverine distance. Our findings have implications for the national recovery plan of this species by demonstrating that N. obscura populations should be managed at a catchment level and highlighting the need to restore habitat and avoid further alteration of the natural hydrology.

The main objectives were to determine if: 1) geologic terrains throughout the Maya area exhibit distinct lead isotope ratios (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/204Pb), and 2) a combination of lead and strontium ratios can enhance sourcing procedures in the Mesoamerica region. We analyzed 60 rock samples for lead isotope ratios and a representative subset of samples for lead, uranium, and thorium concentrations across the Maya region, including the Northern Lowlands of the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula, the Southern Lowlands of Guatemala and Belize, the Volcanic Highlands, the Belizean Maya Mountains, and the Metamorphic Province/Motagua Valley. Although there is some overlap within certain sub-regions, particularly the geologically diverse Metamorphic Province, lead isotopes can be used to distinguish between the Northern Lowlands, the Southern Lowlands, and the Volcanic Highlands. The distinct lead isotope ratios in the sub-regions are related to the geology of the Maya area, exhibiting a general trend in the lowlands of geologically younger rocks in the north to older rocks in the south, and Cenozoic volcanic rocks in the southern highlands. Combined with other sourcing techniques such as strontium (87Sr/86Sr) and oxygen (δ18O), a regional baseline for lead isotope ratios can contribute to the development of lead isoscapes in the Maya area, and may help to distinguish among geographic sub-regions at a finer scale than has been previously possible.

This polyprotein was expressed by a plasmid DNA vaccine vector (DNA) and by two attenuated poxvirus vectors, modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and fowlpox virus of the FP9 strain. MVAL3SEPTL boosted anti-thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (anti-TRAP) and anti-liver stage antigen 1 (anti-LSA1) CD8(+) T cell responses when primed by single antigen TRAP- or LSA1-expressing DNAs, respectively, but not by DNA-L3SEPTL.

Peptide-specific T cells secreted IFN-gamma and were cytotoxic. IFN-gamma-secreting T cells specific for each of the six antigens were induced after vaccination with L3SEPTL, supporting the use of polyprotein inserts to induce multispecific T cells against P. falciparum.

Diet and physical activity lifestyle behaviors are modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes and are shaped by culture, potentially influencing diabetes health disparities.
OBJECTIVES:
We examined whether ethnic identity-the strength of attachment to one's ethnic group, and a long-standing focus of psychological research-could help account for variations in lifestyle behaviors within a diverse population at high risk for chronic disease.
METHODS:
Using data from the Gestational Diabetes' Effects on Moms trial, this US-based cross-sectional study included 1463 pregnant women (74% from minority ethnic/racial groups; 46% born outside the US) with gestational diabetes (GDM), a common pregnancy complication conferring high risk for type 2 diabetes after delivery. Mixed linear regression models examined whether ethnic identity is associated with lifestyle behaviors after adjusting for demographic, clinical, and acculturative characteristics (e.g., nativity and length of residence in the US).
RESULTS:
In the overall sample, a one-unit increase in ethnic identity score was significantly associated with 3% greater fiber intake, 4% greater fruit/vegetable intake, 11% greater total activity, and 11% greater walking (p values < 0.01). Within ethnic/racial groups, a one-unit increase in ethnic identity score was significantly associated with 17% greater fiber intake among Filipina women; 5% lower total caloric intake among non-Hispanic White women; and 40% greater total activity, 35% greater walking, and 8% greater total caloric intake among Latina women (p values ≤ 0.03).

Results from this large study suggest that ethnic group attachment is associated with some lifestyle behaviors, independent of acculturation indicators, among young women with GDM who are at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Stronger ethnic identity may promote certain choices known to be associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Prospective research is needed to clarify the temporal nature of associations between ethnic identity and modifiable diabetes risk factors.

25198534,2014,"Perennial forms of Gossypium hirsutum are classified under seven races. Five Mesoamerican races would have been derived from the wild race 'yucatanense' from northern Yucatán. 'Marie-Galante', the main race in the Caribbean, would have developed from introgression with G. barbadense. The racial status of coastal populations from the Caribbean has not been clearly defined. We combined Ecological Niche Modeling with an analysis of SSR marker diversity, to elucidate the relationships among cultivated, feral and wild populations of perennial cottons. Out of 954 records of occurrence in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean, 630 were classified into four categories cultivated, feral (disturbed and secondary habitats), wild/feral (protected habitats), and truly wild cotton (TWC) populations. The widely distributed three first categories cannot be differentiated on ecological grounds, indicating they mostly belong to the domesticated pool. In contrast, TWC are restricted to the driest and hottest littoral habitats, in northern Yucatán and in the Caribbean (from Venezuela to Florida), as confirmed by their climatic envelope in the factorial analysis. Extrapolating this TWC climatic model to South America and the Pacific Ocean points towards places where other wild representatives of tetraploid Gossypium species have been encountered. The genetic analysis sample comprised 42 TWC accessions from 12 sites and 68 feral accessions from 18 sites; at nine sites, wild and feral accessions were collected in close vicinity. Principal coordinate analysis, neighbor joining, and STRUCTURE consistently showed a primary divergence between TWC and feral cottons, and a secondary divergence separating 'Marie-Galante' from all other feral accessions. This strong genetic structure contrasts strikingly with the absence of geographic differentiation. Our results show that TWC populations of Mesoamerica and the Caribbean constitute a homogenous gene pool. Furthermore, the relatively low genetic divergence between the Mesoamerican and Caribbean domesticated pools supports the hypothesis of domestication of G. hirsutum in northern Yucatán. ",1,1,6,5,18
23691108,2013,"Genetic variation of 49 human papillomavirus (HPV) 6 and 22 HPV11 isolates from recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) (n = 17), genital warts (n = 43), anal cancer (n = 6) and cervical neoplasia cells (n = 5), was determined by sequencing the long control region (LCR) and the E6 and E7 genes. Comparative analysis of genetic variability was examined to determine whether different disease states resulting from HPV6 or HPV11 infection cluster into distinct variant groups. Sequence variation analysis of HPV6 revealed that isolates cluster into variants within previously described HPV6 lineages, with the majority (65%) clustering to HPV6 sublineage B1 across the three genomic regions examined. Overall 72 HPV6 and 25 HPV11 single nucleotide variations, insertions and deletions were observed within samples examined. In addition, missense alterations were observed in the E6/E7 genes for 6 HPV6 and 5 HPV11 variants. No nucleotide variations were identified in any isolates at the four E2 binding sites for HPV6 or HPV11, nor were any isolates found to be identical to the HPV6 lineage A or HPV11 sublineage A1 reference genomes. Overall, a high degree of sequence conservation was observed between isolates across each of the regions investigated for both HPV6 and HPV11. Genetic variants identified a slight association with HPV6 and anogenital lesions (p = 0.04). This study provides important information on the genetic diversity of circulating HPV 6 and HPV11 variants within the Australian population and supports the observation that the majority of HPV6 isolates cluster to the HPV6 sublineage B1 with anogenital lesions demonstrating an association with this sublineage (p = 0.02). Comparative analysis of Australian isolates for both HPV6 and HPV11 to those from other geographical regions based on the LCR revealed a high degree of sequence similarity throughout the world, confirming previous observations that there are no geographically specific variants for these HPV types.",1,0,1,0,2
20415538,2010,"A new species of parvovirus, tentatively named human bocavirus 4 (HBoV4), was genetically characterized. Among 641 feces samples obtained from children and adults, the most commonly detected bocavirus species were, in descending order, HBoV2, HBoV3, HBoV4, and HBoV1, with an HBoV2 prevalence of 21% and 26% in Nigerian and Tunisian children, respectively. HBoV3 or HBoV4 species were found in 12 of 192 patients with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis in Tunisia and Nigeria and 0 of 96 healthy Tunisian contacts (P = .01). Evidence of extensive recombination at the NP1 and VP1 gene boundary between and within bocavirus species was found. The high degree of genetic diversity seen among the human bocaviruses found in feces specimens, relative to the highly homogeneous HBoV1, suggest that this worldwide-distributed respiratory pathogen may have recently evolved from an enteric bocavirus after acquiring an expanded tropism favoring the respiratory tract. Elucidating the possible role of the newly identified enteric bocaviruses in human diseases, including acute flaccid paralysis and diarrhea, will require further epidemiological studies.",1,1,3,0,5
23110233,2012,"Pigeon 'milk' and mammalian milk have functional similarities in terms of nutritional benefit and delivery of immunoglobulins to the young. Mammalian milk has been clearly shown to aid in the development of the immune system and microbiota of the young, but similar effects have not yet been attributed to pigeon 'milk'. Therefore, using a chicken model, we investigated the effect of pigeon 'milk' on immune gene expression in the Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) and on the composition of the caecal microbiota. Chickens fed pigeon 'milk' had a faster rate of growth and a better feed conversion ratio than control chickens. There was significantly enhanced expression of immune-related gene pathways and interferon-stimulated genes in the GALT of pigeon 'milk'-fed chickens. These pathways include the innate immune response, regulation of cytokine production and regulation of B cell activation and proliferation. The caecal microbiota of pigeon 'milk'-fed chickens was significantly more diverse than control chickens, and appears to be affected by prebiotics in pigeon 'milk', as well as being directly seeded by bacteria present in pigeon 'milk'. Our results demonstrate that pigeon 'milk' has further modes of action which make it functionally similar to mammalian milk. We hypothesise that pigeon 'lactation' and mammalian lactation evolved independently but resulted in similarly functional products.",1,1,3,0,0
1986990,1991,"Natural selection for electrolyte conservation has likely been the norm throughout human evolutionary history. However, the current patterns of excessive dietary salt intake create the potential for salt overload. Under these conditions, hypertension may be considered an expected pathological response to an evolutionarily new constraint. The transatlantic Middle Passage may have created a genetic bottleneck for salt conservation in African-Americans. Although the initial consequences of this important historical event probably constricted genetic variability and further magnified the potential for salt-sensitive hypertension, the Middle Passage undoubtedly also served as a more generalized major source of environmental stress and may have stimulated subsequent hereditary diversity in the survivors of this holocaust and their descendants. Accelerated rates of mutation, genetic recombination, and transposable genetic elements in conjunction with enhanced opportunities for gene flow, new selective pressures, and drift have all contributed to the tremendous heterogeneity of contemporary African-Americans. It is unlikely that a single genetic event, even of the severity of the Middle Passage, can account comprehensively for the apparent susceptibility of this macroethnic group to high blood pressure and hypertension.",1,0,1,2,2
24625862,2014,"Sex chromosomes turn over rapidly in some taxonomic groups, where closely related species have different sex chromosomes. Although there are many examples of sex chromosome turnover, we know little about the functional roles of sex chromosome turnover in phenotypic diversification and genomic evolution. The sympatric pair of Japanese threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) provides an excellent system to address these questions: the Japan Sea species has a neo-sex chromosome system resulting from a fusion between an ancestral Y chromosome and an autosome, while the sympatric Pacific Ocean species has a simple XY sex chromosome system. Furthermore, previous quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping demonstrated that the Japan Sea neo-X chromosome contributes to phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation between these sympatric species. To investigate the genomic basis for the accumulation of genes important for speciation on the neo-X chromosome, we conducted whole genome sequencing of males and females of both the Japan Sea and the Pacific Ocean species. No substantial degeneration has yet occurred on the neo-Y chromosome, but the nucleotide sequence of the neo-X and the neo-Y has started to diverge, particularly at regions near the fusion. The neo-sex chromosomes also harbor an excess of genes with sex-biased expression. Furthermore, genes on the neo-X chromosome showed higher non-synonymous substitution rates than autosomal genes in the Japan Sea lineage. Genomic regions of higher sequence divergence between species, genes with divergent expression between species, and QTL for inter-species phenotypic differences were found not only at the regions near the fusion site, but also at other regions along the neo-X chromosome. Neo-sex chromosomes can therefore accumulate substitutions causing species differences even in the absence of substantial neo-Y degeneration. ",1,1,12,0,5
30535258,2019,"MOTIVATION:
Glycans are biomolecules that take an important role in the biological processes of living organisms. They form diverse, complicated structures such as branched and cyclic forms. Web3 Unique Representation of Carbohydrate Structures (WURCS) was proposed as a new linear notation for uniquely representing glycans during the GlyTouCan project. WURCS defines rules for complex glycan structures that other text formats did not support, and so it is possible to represent a wide variety glycans. However, WURCS uses a complicated nomenclature, so it is not human-readable. Therefore, we aimed to support the interpretation of WURCS by converting WURCS to the most basic and widely used format IUPAC.
RESULTS:
In this study, we developed GlycanFormatConverter and succeeded in converting WURCS to the three kinds of IUPAC formats (IUPAC-Extended, IUPAC-Condensed and IUPAC-Short). Furthermore, we have implemented functionality to import IUPAC-Extended, KEGG Chemical Function (KCF) and LinearCode formats and to export WURCS. We have thoroughly tested our GlycanFormatConverter and were able to show that it was possible to convert all the glycans registered in the GlyTouCan repository, with exceptions owing only to the limitations of the original format. The source code for this conversion tool has been released as an open source tool.

26116928,2015,"BACKGROUND:
With more and more genomes being sequenced, detecting synteny between genomes becomes more and more important. However, for microorganisms the genomic divergence quickly becomes large, resulting in different codon usage and shuffling of gene order and gene elements such as exons.
RESULTS:
We present Proteny, a methodology to detect synteny between diverged genomes. It operates on the amino acid sequence level to be insensitive to codon usage adaptations and clusters groups of exons disregarding order to handle diversity in genomic ordering between genomes. Furthermore, Proteny assigns significance levels to the syntenic clusters such that they can be selected on statistical grounds. Finally, Proteny provides novel ways to visualize results at different scales, facilitating the exploration and interpretation of syntenic regions. We test the performance of Proteny on a standard ground truth dataset, and we illustrate the use of Proteny on two closely related genomes (two different strains of Aspergillus niger) and on two distant genomes (two species of Basidiomycota). In comparison to other tools, we find that Proteny finds clusters with more true homologies in fewer clusters that contain more genes, i.e. Proteny is able to identify a more consistent synteny. Further, we show how genome rearrangements, assembly errors, gene duplications and the conservation of specific genes can be easily studied with Proteny.

17452370,2007,"The members of the huntingtin-interacting protein-1 (HIP1) family, HIP1 and HIP1-related (HIP1r), are multi-domain proteins that interact with inositol lipids, clathrin and actin. HIP1 is over-expressed in a variety of cancers and both HIP1 and HIP1r prolong the half-life of multiple growth factor receptors. To better understand the physiological importance of the HIP1 family in vivo, we have analyzed a large cohort of double Hip1/Hip1r knockout (DKO) mice. All DKO mice were dwarfed, afflicted with severe vertebral defects and died in early adulthood. These phenotypes were not observed during early adulthood in the single Hip1 or Hip1r knockouts, indicating that HIP1 and HIP1r compensate for one another. Despite the ability of HIP1 and HIP1r to modulate growth factor receptor levels when over-expressed, studies herein using DKO fibroblasts indicate that the HIP1 family is not necessary for endocytosis but is necessary for the maintenance of diverse adult tissues in vivo. To test if human HIP1 can function similar to mouse HIP1, transgenic mice with 'ubiquitous' expression of the human HIP1 cDNA were generated and crossed with DKO mice. Strikingly, the compound human HIP1 transgenic DKO mice were completely free from dwarfism and spinal defects. This successful rescue demonstrates that the human HIP1 protein shares some interchangeable functions with both HIP1 and HIP1r in vivo. In addition, we conclude that the degenerative phenotypes seen in the DKO mice are due mainly to HIP1 and HIP1r protein deficiency rather than altered expression of neighboring genes or disrupted intronic elements.",1,1,5,0,0

Because there are currently no national guidelines for undergraduate degrees in global health, each of these programs was developed along individual lines. To guide the development of future global health majors, we conducted a systematic review of undergraduate majors in global health. We identified eight programs and invited program directors or representatives to a symposium at the Consortium of Universities for Global Health 2016 conference to review their existing undergraduate major in global health and to discuss lessons learned and recommendations for other colleges and universities seeking to develop undergraduate degrees in global health. We noted significant diversity among the existing programs in terms of required courses, international field experiences, and thesis research projects. In this review, we describe these global health programs, their student characteristics, as well as the key educational competencies, program requirements, and core global health courses.

20351254,2010,"Gene regulatory networks have been shown to share some common aspects with commonplace social governance structures. Thus, we can get some intuition into their organization by arranging them into well-known hierarchical layouts. These hierarchies, in turn, can be placed between the extremes of autocracies, with well-defined levels and clear chains of command, and democracies, without such defined levels and with more co-regulatory partnerships between regulators. In general, the presence of partnerships decreases the variation in information flow amongst nodes within a level, more evenly distributing stress. Here we study various regulatory networks (transcriptional, modification, and phosphorylation) for five diverse species, Escherichia coli to human. We specify three levels of regulators--top, middle, and bottom--which collectively govern the non-regulator targets lying in the lowest fourth level. We define quantities for nodes, levels, and entire networks that measure their degree of collaboration and autocratic vs. democratic character. We show individual regulators have a range of partnership tendencies: Some regulate their targets in combination with other regulators in local instantiations of democratic structure, whereas others regulate mostly in isolation, in more autocratic fashion. Overall, we show that in all networks studied the middle level has the highest collaborative propensity and coregulatory partnerships occur most frequently amongst midlevel regulators, an observation that has parallels in corporate settings where middle managers must interact most to ensure organizational effectiveness. There is, however, one notable difference between networks in different species: The amount of collaborative regulation and democratic character increases markedly with overall genomic complexity.",1,0,1,0,0
22022422,2011,"Assessment of the microbial diversity residing in arthropod vectors of medical importance is crucial for monitoring endemic infections, for surveillance of newly emerging zoonotic pathogens, and for unraveling the associated bacteria within its host. The tick Ixodes ricinus is recognized as the primary European vector of disease-causing bacteria in humans. Despite I. ricinus being of great public health relevance, its microbial communities remain largely unexplored to date. Here we evaluate the pathogen-load and the microbiome in single adult I. ricinus by using 454- and Illumina-based metagenomic approaches. Genomic DNA-derived sequences were taxonomically profiled using a computational approach based on the BWA algorithm, allowing for the identification of known tick-borne pathogens at the strain level and the putative tick core microbiome. Additionally, we assessed and compared the bacterial taxonomic profile in nymphal and adult I. ricinus pools collected from two distinct geographic regions in Northern Italy by means of V6-16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing and community based ecological analysis. A total of 108 genera belonging to representatives of all bacterial phyla were detected and a rapid qualitative assessment for pathogenic bacteria, such as Borrelia, Rickettsia and Candidatus Neoehrlichia, and for other bacteria with mutualistic relationship or undetermined function, such as Wolbachia and Rickettsiella, was possible. Interestingly, the ecological analysis revealed that the bacterial community structure differed between the examined geographic regions and tick life stages. This finding suggests that the environmental context (abiotic and biotic factors) and host-selection behaviors affect their microbiome.Our data provide the most complete picture to date of the bacterial communities present within I. ricinus under natural conditions by using high-throughput sequencing technologies.

17292566,2006,"Splice variants of the basic helix-loop-helix myoblast determination factor (myoD) have not been previously found in vertebrates. Here we report the identification and characterization of three alternative transcripts of a myoD paralogue from the tiger pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes). The T. rubripes myoD1 gene (TmyoD1) has 3 exons and 2 introns and it is present on scaffold 104, in a region of conserved synteny with zebrafish. The isoform TMyoD1-alpha is a putative protein of 281 residues that contains the basic, helix-loop-helix and helix III domains and shares 61%, 56%, 51%, 49% and 56% overall identity with zebrafish, Xenopus, mouse, human and chicken MyoD1, respectively. TMyoD1-beta arises from an alternative 3' splice site and differs from TMyoD1-alpha by a 26-residue insertion adjacent to helix III, which is one of the functional domains required for chromatin remodelling. The third alternative transcript, TmyoD1-gamma, retains intron I and has two premature termination codons far from the 3'-most exon-exon junction. TmyoD1-gamma is therefore likely to be degraded by nonsense-mediated decay, an important widespread post-transcriptional mechanism that regulates transcript levels. Analysis of gene expression by qPCR revealed that TmyoD1-alpha was the most abundant transcript in fast and slow myotomal muscle. TmyoD1-alpha expression was 2-fold higher in fast muscle of juvenile fish that were actively producing new myotubes compared to adult stages that had stopped recruiting fast muscle fibres. A similar expression pattern was observed for TmyoD1-alpha in slow muscle but the differences were not significant. Transcript levels of TmyoD1-gamma only varied significantly in fast muscle and were 5-fold higher in adult compared to juvenile stages. Significant differences in expression of TmyoD1 splice variants were also observed during embryonic development. The differential expression of three alternative transcripts of myoD1 in developing and adult myotomal muscle of T. rubripes supports the hypothesis that diversity generated by alternative splicing may be of functional significance in muscle development in this species.",1,1,4,0,0
25411287,2014,"BACKGROUND:
In high-income countries, high socioeconomic status (SES) is generally associated with a healthier diet, but whether social differences in dietary intake are also present in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains to be established.
OBJECTIVE:
We performed a systematic review of studies that assessed the relation between SES and dietary intake in LMICs.
METHODS:
We carried out a systematic review of cohort and cross-sectional studies in adults in LMICs and published between 1996 and 2013. We assessed associations between markers of SES or urban and rural settings and dietary intake.
RESULTS:
A total of 33 studies from 17 LMICs were included (5 low-income countries and 12 middle-income countries; 31 cross-sectional and 2 longitudinal studies). A majority of studies were conducted in Brazil (8), China (6), and Iran (4). High SES or living in urban areas was associated with higher intakes of calories; protein; total fat; cholesterol; polyunsaturated, saturated, and monounsaturated fatty acids; iron; and vitamins A and C and with lower intakes of carbohydrates and fiber. High SES was also associated with higher fruit and/or vegetable consumption, diet quality, and diversity. Although very few studies were performed in low-income countries, similar patterns were generally observed in both LMICs except for fruit intake, which was lower in urban than in rural areas in low-income countries.
CONCLUSIONS:
In LMICs, high SES or living in urban areas is associated with overall healthier dietary patterns. However, it is also related to higher energy, cholesterol, and saturated fat intakes. Social inequalities in dietary intake should be considered in the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases in LMICs.

32221398,2020,"To facilitate the utility of SNP-based genotyping, we developed a new method called target SNP-seq which combines the advantages of multiplex PCR amplification and high throughput sequencing. Compared with KASP, Microarrays, GBS and other SNP genotyping methods, target SNP-seq is flexible both in SNPs and samples, yields high accuracy, especially when genotyping genome wide perfect SNPs with high polymorphism and conserved flanking sequences, and is cost-effective, requiring 3 days and $7 for per DNA sample to genotype hundreds of SNP loci. The present study established a DNA fingerprint of 261 cucumber varieties by target SNP-seq with 163 perfect SNPs from 4,612,350 SNPs based on 182 cucumber resequencing datasets. Four distinct subpopulations were found in 261 Chinese cucumber varieties: the north China type, the south China type, the Europe type, and the Xishuangbanna type. The north China type and Xishuangbanna type harbored lower genetic diversity, indicating greater risk of genetic erosion in these two subpopulations. Furthermore, a core set of 24 SNPs was able to distinguish 99% of the 261 cucumber varieties. 29 core cucumber backbone varieties in China were identified. Therefore, target SNP-seq provides a new way to screen out core SNP loci from the whole genome for DNA fingerprinting of crop varieties.

However, genetic resistance and fungicides often fail to manage P. capsici due to limited knowledge on the molecular biology and basis of P. capsici pathogenicity.

Over 11 million reads were generated for each cDNA library analyzed. After read mapping to the gene models of P. capsici reference genome, 13,901, 14,633 and 14,695 putative genes were identified from the reads of the MY, ZO and GC libraries, respectively. Comparative analysis between two of samples showed major differences between the expressed gene content of MY, ZO and GC stages. A large number of genes associated with specific stages and pathogenicity were identified, including 98 predicted effector genes. The transcriptional levels of 19 effector genes during the developmental and host infection stages of P. capsici were validated by RT-PCR. Ectopic expression in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that P. capsici RXLR and Crinkler effectors can suppress host cell death triggered by diverse elicitors including P. capsici elicitin and NLP effectors.

16288659,2005,"BACKGROUND:
HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination are significant determinants of HIV transmission in the Caribbean island nation of Trinidad and Tobago (T&T), where the adult HIV/AIDS prevalence is 2.5%. T&T is a spiritually-aware society and over 104 religious groups are represented. This religious diversity creates a complex social environment for the transmission of a sexually transmitted infection like HIV/AIDS. Religious leaders are esteemed in T&T's society and may use their position and frequent interactions with the public to promote HIV/AIDS awareness, fight stigma and discrimination, and exercise compassion for people living with HIV/AIDS (PWHA). Some religious groups have initiated HIV/AIDS education programs within their membership, but previous studies suggest that HIV/AIDS remains a stigmatized infection in many religious organizations. The present study investigates how the perception of HIV/AIDS as a sexually transmitted infection impacts religious representatives' incentives to respond to HIV/AIDS in their congregations and communities. In correlation, the study explores how the experiences of PWHA in religious gatherings impact healing and coping with HIV/AIDS.
METHODS:
Between November 2002 and April 2003, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 religious representatives from 10 Christian, Hindu and Muslim denominations. The majority of respondents were leaders of religious services, while two were active congregation members. Religious groups were selected based upon the methods of Brathwaite. Briefly, 26 religious groups with the largest followings according to 2000 census data were identified in Trinidad and Tobago. From this original list, 10 religious groups in Northwest Trinidad were selected to comprise a representative sample of the island's main denominations. In-depth interviews with PWHA were conducted during the same study period, 2002-2003. Four individuals were selected from a care and support group located in Port of Spain based upon their perceived willingness to discuss religious affiliation and describe how living with a terminal infection has affected their spiritual lives. The interviewer, a United States Fulbright Scholar, explained the nature and purpose of the study to all participants. Relevant ethical procedures associated with the collection of interview data were adopted: interviews were conducted in a non-coercive manner and confidentiality was assured. All participants provided verbal consent, and agreed to be interviewed without financial or other incentive. Ethics approval was granted on behalf of the Caribbean Conference of Churches Ethics Committee. Interview questions followed a guideline, and employed an open-ended format to facilitate discussion. All interviews were recorded and transcribed by the interviewer.
RESULTS:
Religious representatives' opinions were grouped into the following categories: rationale for the spread of HIV/AIDS, abstinence, condom use, sexuality and homosexuality, compassion, experiences with PWHA, recommendations and current approach to addressing HIV/AIDS in congregations. Religious representatives expressed a measure of acceptance of HIV/AIDS and overwhelmingly upheld compassion for PWHA. Some statements, however, suggested that HIV/AIDS stigma pervades Trinidad's religious organizations. For many representatives, HIV/AIDS was associated with a promiscuous lifestyle and/or homosexuality. Representatives had varying levels of interaction with PWHA, but personal experiences were positively associated with current involvement in HIV/AIDS initiatives. All 4 PWHA interviewed identified themselves as belonging to Christian denominations. Three out of the 4 PWHA described discriminatory experiences with pastors or congregation members during gatherings for religious services. Nonetheless, PWHA expressed an important role for faith and religion in coping with HIV.
CONCLUSIONS:
Religious groups in Trinidad are being challenged to promote a clear and consistent response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; a response that may reflect personal experiences and respect religious doctrine in the context of sex and sexuality.

31803919,2020,"There is growing evidence that oxytocin (OXT), a hypothalamic hormone well recognized for its effects in inducing parturition and lactation, has important metabolic effects in both sexes. The purpose of this review is to summarize the physiologic effects of OXT on metabolism and to explore its therapeutic potential for metabolic disorders. In model systems, OXT promotes weight loss by decreasing energy intake. Pair-feeding studies suggest that OXT-induced weight loss may also be partly due to increased energy expenditure and/or lipolysis. In humans, OXT appears to modulate both homeostatic and reward-driven food intake, although the observed response depends on nutrient milieu (eg, obese vs. nonobese), clinical characteristics (eg, sex), and experimental paradigm. In animal models, OXT is anabolic to muscle and bone, which is consistent with OXT-induced weight loss occurring primarily via fat loss. In some human observational studies, circulating OXT concentrations are also positively associated with lean mass and bone mineral density. The impact of exogenous OXT on human obesity is the focus of ongoing investigation. Future randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in humans should include rigorous, standardized, and detailed assessments of adherence, adverse effects, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy in the diverse populations that may benefit from OXT, in particular those in whom hypothalamic OXT signaling may be abnormal or impaired (eg, individuals with Sim1 deficiency, Prader-Willi syndrome, or craniopharyngioma). Future studies will also have the opportunity to investigate the characteristics of new OXT mimetic peptides and the obligation to consider long-term effects, especially when OXT is given to children and adolescents.

16109836,2005,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cell surface receptors that mediate physiological responses to a diverse array of stimuli. GPCRs have traditionally been thought to act as monomers, but recent evidence suggests that GPCRs may form dimers (or higher-order oligomers) as part of their normal trafficking and function. In fact, certain GPCRs seem to have a strict requirement for heterodimerization to attain proper surface expression and functional activity. Even those GPCRs that do not absolutely require heterodimerization may still specifically associate with other GPCR subtypes, sometimes resulting in dramatic effects on receptor pharmacology, signaling, and/or internalization. Understanding the specificity and functional significance of GPCR heterodimerization is of tremendous clinical importance since GPCRs are the molecular targets for numerous therapeutic drugs.",1,0,1,0,0
26084502,2015,"BACKGROUND:
Trunk diseases threaten the longevity and productivity of grapevines in all viticulture production systems. They are caused by distantly-related fungi that form chronic wood infections. Variation in wood-decay abilities and production of phytotoxic compounds are thought to contribute to their unique disease symptoms. We recently released the draft sequences of Eutypa lata, Neofusicoccum parvum and Togninia minima, causal agents of Eutypa dieback, Botryosphaeria dieback and Esca, respectively. In this work, we first expanded genomic resources to three important trunk pathogens, Diaporthe ampelina, Diplodia seriata, and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, causal agents of Phomopsis dieback, Botryosphaeria dieback, and Esca, respectively. Then we integrated all currently-available information into a genome-wide comparative study to identify gene families potentially associated with host colonization and disease development.
RESULTS:
The integration of RNA-seq, comparative and ab initio approaches improved the protein-coding gene prediction in T. minima, whereas shotgun sequencing yielded nearly complete genome drafts of Dia. ampelina, Dip. seriata, and P. chlamydospora. The predicted proteomes of all sequenced trunk pathogens were annotated with a focus on functions likely associated with pathogenesis and virulence, namely (i) wood degradation, (ii) nutrient uptake, and (iii) toxin production. Specific patterns of gene family expansion were described using Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution, which revealed lineage-specific evolution of distinct mechanisms of virulence, such as specific cell wall oxidative functions and secondary metabolic pathways in N. parvum, Dia. ampelina, and E. lata. Phylogenetically-informed principal component analysis revealed more similar repertoires of expanded functions among species that cause similar symptoms, which in some cases did not reflect phylogenetic relationships, thereby suggesting patterns of convergent evolution.
CONCLUSIONS:
This study describes the repertoires of putative virulence functions in the genomes of ubiquitous grapevine trunk pathogens. Gene families with significantly faster rates of gene gain can now provide a basis for further studies of in planta gene expression, diversity by genome re-sequencing, and targeted reverse genetic approaches. The functional validation of potential virulence factors will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis and virulence, which ultimately will enable the development of accurate diagnostic tools and effective disease management.

10842582,1999,"Damage to sensory cells and neurones of the inner ear, induced by ototoxic drugs, physical stimulation, or even normal aging, occurs by mechanisms that are not yet fully elucidated. However, for the individual the consequent loss of hearing can be devastating. This the concept that, in some instances, this brain cell death may be preventable has provided an exciting and novel route to thwart the degenerative process. Signals that trigger cell death can be as diverse as the removal of essential growth factors, damage by exogenous toxins (including ototoxic drugs), free radicals, and excitotoxins. An important facet to the newly discovered death cascade is that it can be halted, and such interventions may rescue the dying cell. The question now remains whether any of the cell death observed on ototoxic or noise-induced hearing loss occurs by an ""active"" programmed mechanism (apoptosis), as physiological cell death does in the developing ear, and if so, whether it can be prevented.",1,1,2,0,0
30929901,2019,"Genomic studies have identified hundreds of candidate genes near loci associated with risk for schizophrenia. To define candidates and their functions, we mutated zebrafish orthologs of 132 human schizophrenia-associated genes. We created a phenotype atlas consisting of whole-brain activity maps, brain structural differences, and profiles of behavioral abnormalities. Phenotypes were diverse but specific, including altered forebrain development and decreased prepulse inhibition. Exploration of these datasets identified promising candidates in more than 10 gene-rich regions, including the magnesium transporter cnnm2 and the translational repressor gigyf2, and revealed shared anatomical sites of activity differences, including the pallium, hypothalamus, and tectum. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered an essential role for the understudied transcription factor znf536 in the development of forebrain neurons implicated in social behavior and stress. This phenotypic landscape of schizophrenia-associated genes prioritizes more than 30 candidates for further study and provides hypotheses to bridge the divide between genetic association and biological mechanism.",1,0,1,0,0
22850877,2012,"Metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to treat, and the presence of metastases greatly reduces a cancer patient's likelihood of long-term survival. The ZEB1 transcriptional repressor promotes metastasis through downregulation of microRNAs (miRs) that are strong inducers of epithelial differentiation and inhibitors of stem cell factors. Given that each miR can target multiple genes with diverse functions, we posited that the prometastatic network controlled by ZEB1 extends beyond these processes. We tested this hypothesis using a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma metastasis driven by ZEB1, human lung carcinoma cells, and human breast carcinoma cells. Transcriptional profiling studies revealed that ZEB1 controls the expression of numerous oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRs, including miR-34a. Ectopic expression of miR-34a decreased tumor cell invasion and metastasis, inhibited the formation of promigratory cytoskeletal structures, suppressed activation of the RHO GTPase family, and regulated a gene expression signature enriched in cytoskeletal functions and predictive of outcome in human lung adenocarcinomas. We identified several miR-34a target genes, including Arhgap1, which encodes a RHO GTPase activating protein that was required for tumor cell invasion. These findings demonstrate that ZEB1 drives prometastatic actin cytoskeletal remodeling by downregulating miR-34a expression and provide a compelling rationale to develop miR-34a as a therapeutic agent in lung cancer patients.",1,0,1,0,0

26690059,2015,"REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor), also known as NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor), is a well-known transcriptional repressor of neural genes in non-neural tissues and stem cells. Dysregulation of REST activity is thought to play a role in diverse diseases including epilepsy, cancer, Down's syndrome and Huntington's disease. The role of REST/NRSF in control of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) fate has never been examined. To evaluate the role of REST in hESCs we developed an inducible REST knockdown system and examined both growth and differentiation over short and long term culture. Interestingly, we have found that altering REST levels in multiple hESC lines does not result in loss of self-renewal but instead leads to increased survival. During differentiation, REST knockdown resulted in increased MAPK/ERK and WNT signaling and increased expression of mesendoderm differentiation markers. Therefore we have uncovered a new role for REST in regulation of growth and early differentiation decisions in human embryonic stem cells. ",1,0,1,0,0
27503759,2016,"Cellular senescence plays an important role in diverse biological processes such as tumorigenesis and organismal aging. However, lack of methods to specifically identify and isolate live senescent cells hampers the precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating cellular senescence. Here, we report that utilization of fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) technology allows isolation of live premature senescent cells induced by doxorubicin treatment. Exposure of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) to a low dose of doxorubicin led to cellular senescent phenotypes including formation of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci indicative of DNA damage, decreased cell proliferation and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity. Importantly, doxorubicin-induced senescent cells were arrested at S/G2/M phases of cell cycle which can be reported by a construct encoding a fragment of hGeminin fused with monomeric Azami-Green (mAG-hGeminin). Flow cytometric sorting of GFP(+) cells from doxorubicin-treated HFFs carrying mAG-hGeminin reporter enabled isolation and enrichment of live senescent cells in the culture.

31166941,2019,"Accurate species delimitation is crucial for studies of phylogeny, phylogeography, ecology, conservation and biogeography. The limits of species and genera in the Characidae family are controversial due to its uncertain phylogenetic relationships, high level of morphological homoplasy and the use of ambiguous morphological characters for descriptions. Here we establish species boundaries for Bryconamericus, Hemibrycon, Knodus and Eretmobrycon (Stevardiinae: Characidae), previously diagnosed with morphology, using three different barcoding approaches (GMYC, PTP, ABGD). Results revealed that species delimitation was successful by the use of a single-gene approach and by following a workflow in the context of integrative taxonomy, making evident problems and mistakes in the cataloging of Characidae species. Hence, it was possible to infer boundaries at genus level for clusters in the trees (GMYC and PTP) and automatic partitions (ABGD) which were consistent with some of recent taxonomic changes proposed in Characidae. We found that discordance cases between methods were linked to limitations of the methods and associated to putative species cluster closely related, some historically problematic in their diagnosis and identification. Furthermore, we suggested taxonomic changes and possibly new species, revealing a high degree of hidden diversity.

21641705,2011,"How far does ethnicity/culture/religion mediate couples' responses to genetic risk? This paper examines the responses of 51 British Pakistani couples referred to a genetics clinic in southern England to counselling about recurrence risks for genetic problems in children. It is based on fieldwork conducted between 2000 and 2004 that combined participant observation of genetics consultations with interviews in respondents' homes. Interviews were conducted with 62 adults in connection with these 51 cases, of which 32 were followed through two or more clinical consultations and 12 through more than one pregnancy. Risk responses were categorized as: taking the risk; postponing; exploring risk management or dismissing the risk as irrelevant to current circumstances. Responses were cross-referenced for associations with the severity of the condition, number of affected and unaffected children, availability of a prenatal test, age, gender, and migration history. I found that most couples were initially risk-takers who already had an unaffected child or children. Couples caring for living children with severe conditions were more likely to postpone. However, the risk responses of 15 couples changed over time, most towards and some away from risk management, reflecting changes in couples' appreciation of the severity of the condition and their subsequent reproductive experiences.

17996081,2007,"BACKGROUND:
We are profoundly ignorant about the diversity of viruses that infect the domain Archaea. Less than 100 have been identified and described and very few of these have had their genomic sequences determined. Here we report the genomic sequence of a previously undescribed archaeal virus.
RESULTS:
Haloarchaeal strains with 16S rRNA gene sequences 98% identical to Halorubrum saccharovorum were isolated from a hypersaline lake in Inner Mongolia. Two lytic viruses infecting these were isolated from the lake water. The BJ1 virus is described in this paper. It has an icosahedral head and tail morphology and most likely a linear double stranded DNA genome exhibiting terminal redundancy. Its genome sequence has 42,271 base pairs with a GC content ofapproximately 65 mol%. The genome of BJ1 is predicted to encode 70 ORFs, including one for a tRNA. Fifty of the seventy ORFs had no identity to data base entries; twenty showed sequence identity matches to archaeal viruses and to haloarchaea. ORFs possibly coding for an origin of replication complex, integrase, helicase and structural capsid proteins were identified. Evidence for viral integration was obtained.
CONCLUSIONS:
The virus described here has a very low sequence identity to any previously described virus. Fifty of the seventy ORFs could not be annotated in any way based on amino acid identities with sequences already present in the databases. Determining functions for ORFs such as these is probably easier using a simple virus as a model system.

33032733,2020,"BACKGROUND:
Left ventricular (LV) hypertrabeculation fulfilling noncompaction cardiomyopathy criteria has been detected in athletes. However, the association between LV noncompaction (LVNC) phenotype and vigorous physical activity (VPA) in the general population is disputed.
OBJECTIVE:
The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between LVNC phenotype on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and accelerometer-measured physical activity (PA) in a cohort of middle-aged nonathlete participants in the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study.
METHODS:
In PESA participants (n = 4,184 subjects free of cardiovascular disease), PA was measured by waist-secured accelerometers. CMR was performed in 705 subjects (mean age 48 ± 4 years, 16% women). VPA was recorded as total minutes per week. The study population was divided into 6 groups: no VPA and 5 sex-specific quintiles of VPA rate (Q1 to Q5). The Petersen criterion for LVNC was evaluated in all subjects undergoing CMR. For participants meeting this criterion (noncompacted-to-compacted ratio ≥2.3), 3 more restrictive LVNC criteria were also evaluated (Jacquier, Grothoff, and Stacey).
RESULTS:
LVNC phenotype prevalence according to the Petersen criterion was significantly higher among participants in the highest VPA quintile (Q5 = 30.5%) than in participants with no VPA (14.2%). The Jacquier and Grothoff criteria were also more frequently fulfilled in participants in the highest VPA quintile (Jacquier Q5 = 27.4% vs. no VPA = 12.8% and Grothoff Q5 = 15.8% vs. no VPA = 7.1%). The prevalence of the systolic Stacey LVNC criterion was low (3.6%) and did not differ significantly between no VPA and Q5.
CONCLUSIONS:
In a community-based study, VPA was associated with a higher prevalence of CMR-detected LVNC phenotype according to diverse established criteria. The association between VPA and LVNC phenotype was independent of LV volumes. According to these data, vigorous recreational PA should be considered as a possible but not uncommon determinant of LV hypertrabeculation in asymptomatic subjects.

16800888,2006,"BACKGROUND:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a genetically complex bacterium which can adopt and switch between a free-living or biofilm lifestyle, a versatility that enables it to thrive in many different environments and contributes to its success as a human pathogen.
RESULTS:
Transcriptomes derived from growth states relevant to the lifestyle of P. aeruginosa were clustered using three different methods (K-means, K-means spectral and hierarchical clustering). The culture conditions used for this study were; biofilms incubated for 8, 14, 24 and 48 hrs, and planktonic culture (logarithmic and stationary phase). This cluster analysis revealed the existence and provided a clear illustration of distinct expression profiles present in the dataset. Moreover, it gave an insight into which genes are up-regulated in planktonic, developing biofilm and confluent biofilm states. In addition, this analysis confirmed the contribution of quorum sensing (QS) and RpoS regulated genes to the biofilm mode of growth, and enabled the identification of a 60.69 Kbp region of the genome associated with stationary phase growth (stationary phase planktonic culture and confluent biofilms).
CONCLUSIONS:
This is the first study to use clustering to separate a large P. aeruginosa microarray dataset consisting of transcriptomes obtained from diverse conditions relevant to its growth, into different expression profiles. These distinct expression profiles not only reveal novel aspects of P. aeruginosa gene expression but also provide a growth specific transcriptomic reference dataset for the research community.

In the present study, Affymetrix® miRNA Array, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for miRNAs and their targets, and miRNA promoter analysis were used to validate the gene expression patterns of miRNAs in Populus trichocarpa plantlets induced with the poplar stem canker pathogen, Botryosphaeria dothidea. Twelve miRNAs (miR156, miR159, miR160, miR164, miR166, miR168, miR172, miR319, miR398, miR408, miR1448, and miR1450) were upregulated in the stem bark of P. trichocarpa, but no downregulated miRNAs were found. Based on analysis of the miRNAs and their targets, a potential co-regulatory network was developed to describe post-transcriptional regulation in the pathological development of poplar stem canker. There was highly complex cross-talk between diverse miRNA pathway responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The results suggest that miR156 is probably an integral component of the miRNA response to all environmental stresses in plants. Cis-regulatory elements were binding sites for the transcription factors (TFs) on DNA. Promoter analysis revealed that TC-rich repeats and a W1-box motif were both tightly related disease response motifs in Populus. Promoter analysis and target analysis of miRNAs also revealed that some TFs regulate their activation/repression. Furthermore, a feedback regulatory network in the pathological development of poplar stem canker is provided.

SSA cannot extrapolate from wealthy countries' research findings because its environment, users and structures are very different and SSA has critical blood shortages. SSA needs to generate its own evidence but research funds are very scarce and need to be carefully targeted to match need. This study aimed to define this need by determining research priorities for blood services in SSA.

Research priorities covered traditional research areas, such as clinical use of blood and infection screening, but also highlighted many new, under-researched topics, mostly concerning blood service 'systems', such as economics, blood components and regulation. Lack of electronic information management systems was an important hindrance to the blood services' ability to generate robust research data. This study has identified and prioritised novel research that will help blood services in SSA to address their own needs including their most urgent problem: the lack of access to adequate blood supplies.

Neck disorders are common, disabling, and costly. The effectiveness of patient education strategies is unclear.
OBJECTIVE:
To assess the short- to long-term effects of therapeutic patient education (TPE) strategies on pain, function, disability, quality of life, global perceived effect, patient satisfaction, knowledge transfer, or behaviour change in adults with neck pain associated with whiplash or non-specific and specific mechanical neck pain with or without radiculopathy or cervicogenic headache.
METHODS:
We searched computerised bibliographic databases (inception to 11 July 2010).
METHODS:
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT) investigating the effectiveness of TPE for acute to chronic neck pain.
METHODS:
Paired independent review authors conducted selection, data abstraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment. We calculated risk ratio (RR) and standardised mean differences (SMD). Heterogeneity was assessed; no studies were pooled.
RESULTS:
Of the 15 selected trials, three were rated low risk of bias. Three TPE themes emerged.Advice focusing on activation: There is moderate quality evidence (one trial, 348 participants) that an educational video of advice focusing on activation was more beneficial for acute whiplash-related pain when compared with no treatment at intermediate-term [RR 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.06)] but not long-term follow-up [0.89 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.21)]. There is low quality evidence (one trial, 102 participants) that a whiplash pamphlet on advice focusing on activation is less beneficial for pain reduction, or no different in improving function and global perceived improvement from generic information given out in emergency care (control) for acute whiplash at short- or intermediate-term follow-up. Low to very low quality evidence (nine trials using diverse educational approaches) showed either no evidence of benefit or difference for varied outcomes. Advice focusing on pain & stress coping skills and workplace ergonomics: Very low quality evidence (three trials, 243 participants) favoured other treatment or showed no difference spanning numerous follow-up periods and disorder subtypes.  Low quality evidence (one trial, 192 participants) favoured specific exercise training for chronic neck pain at short-term follow-up.Self-care strategies: Very low quality evidence (one trial, 58 participants) indicated that self-care strategies did not relieve pain for acute to chronic neck pain at short-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS:
With the exception of one trial, this review has not shown effectiveness for educational interventions, including advice to activate, advice on stress-coping skills, workplace ergonomics and self-care strategies. Future research should be founded on sound adult learning theory and learning skill acquisition.

18052527,2007,"The fetal brain is highly vulnerable to teratogens, including many infectious agents. As a consequence of prenatal infection, many children suffer severe and permanent brain injury and dysfunction. Because most animal models of congenital brain infection do not strongly mirror human disease, the models are highly limited in their abilities to shed light on the pathogenesis of these diseases. The animal model for congenital lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, however, does not suffer from this limitation. LCMV is a well-known human pathogen. When the infection occurs during pregnancy, the virus can infect the fetus, and the developing brain is particularly vulnerable. Children with congenital LCMV infection often have substantial neurological deficits. The neonatal rat inoculated with LCMV is a superb model system of human congenital LCMV infection. Virtually all of the neuropathologic changes observed in humans congenitally infected with LCMV, including microencephaly, encephalomalacia, chorioretinitis, porencephalic cysts, neuronal migration disturbances, periventricular infection, and cerebellar hypoplasia, are reproduced in the rat model. Within the developing rat brain, LCMV selectively targets mitotically active neuronal precursors. Thus, the targets of infection and sites of pathology depend on host age at the time of infection. The rat model has further shown that the pathogenic changes induced by LCMV infection are both virus-mediated and immune-mediated. Furthermore, different brain regions simultaneously infected with LCMV can undergo widely different pathologic changes, reflecting different brain region-virus-immune system interactions. Because the neonatal rat inoculated with LCMV so faithfully reproduces the diverse neuropathology observed in the human counterpart, the rat model system is a highly valuable tool for the study of congenital LCMV infection and of all prenatal brain infections In addition, because LCMV induces delayed-onset neuronal loss after the virus has been cleared, the neonatal rat infected with LCMV may be an excellent model system to study neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases whose etiologies are hypothesized to be virus-induced, such as autism, schizophrenia, and temporal lobe epilepsy.",1,1,4,0,0
24997040,2014,"Interactions between metabolism and immunity play a pivotal role in the development of obesity-associated chronic co-morbidities. Obesity involves impairment of immune function affecting both the innate and adaptive immune system. This leads to increased risk of infections as well as chronic low-grade inflammation, which in turn causes metabolic dysfunction (e.g. insulin resistance) and chronic disease (e.g. type-2 diabetes). Gut microbiota has emerged as one of the key factors regulating early events triggering inflammation associated with obesity and metabolic dysfunction. This effect seems to be related to diet- and obesity-associated changes in gut microbiota composition and to increased translocation of immunogenic bacterial products, which activate innate and adaptive immunity in the gut and beyond, contributing to an increase in inflammatory tone. Innate immune receptors, like Toll-like receptors (TLRs), are known to be up-regulated in the tissue affected by most inflammatory disorders and activated by both specific microbial components and dietary lipids. This triggers several signaling transduction pathways (e.g. JNK and IKKβ/NF-κB), leading to inflammatory cytokine and chemokine (TNF-α, IL-1, MCP1) production and to inflammatory cell recruitment, causing insulin resistance. T-cell differentiation into effector inflammatory or regulatory T cells also depends on the type of TLR activated and on cytokine production, which in turn depends upon gut microbiota-diet interactions.

29207554,2017,"OBJECTIVE:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the synergetic effect of child sensitive social protection programs, augmented by a capacity building for social protection and embedded within existing government's targeted resource transfers for families on child nutritional status.
DESIGN:
A repeat cross-sectional quasi-experimental design with measures taken pre- (October-December 2009) and post- (December 2014-February 2015) intervention in the intervention and comparison district. The comparison district received standard social welfare services in the form of targeted resource transfers (TRTs) for eligible families. The intervention district received the TRTs plus a child cash payment, augmented by a capacity building for effective social protection outcomes. Propensity scores were used in difference-in-differences models to compare the changes over time between the intervention and control groups.
RESULTS:
Propensity score matched/weighted models produced better results than the unmatched analyses, and hence we report findings from the radius matching. The intervention resulted in a 5.16 (95% CI: 9.55, 0.77), 7.35 (95% CI: 11.62, 3.08) and 2.84 (95% CI: 5.58, 0.10) percentage point reduction in the prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting among children under the age, respectively. The intervention impact was greater in boys than girls for stunting and wasting; and greater in girls than boys for underweight. The intervention also resulted in a 6.66 (95% CI: 2.13, 3.18), 11.40 (95% CI: 16.66, 6.13), and 4.0 (95% CI: 6.43, 1.78) percentage point reduction in the prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting among older children (≥24 months). No impact was observed among younger children (<24 months).
CONCLUSIONS:
Targeted resource transfers for families, augmented with a child sensitive social protection program and capacity building for social protection can address effectively child malnutrition. To increase the intervention effectiveness on younger children, the child cash payment amount needs to be revisited and closely embedded into infant and young child feeding initiatives, but also adjusted to equate to 20% of household expenditure or more to maximize the diversity of food available to young children.

31705024,2019,"Understanding community assembly mechanisms is helpful to predict community dynamics. To explore which community assembly mechanism(s) drive(s) the grassland restoration in semi-arid region, we investigated the relationships between plant trait and species relative abundance (SRA), and estimated community functional diversity indices for each community under different treatments (enclosure, grazing and mowing treatment) in a restoration region of Stipa grandis - Leymus chinensis communities in the northern China from 2010 to 2012. There was a high fraction of significant relationships between trait value and SRA, suggesting that niche theory structured the grassland restoration in this region. The functional richness was higher and the functional divergence was lower in the enclosure community than that in the grazing or mowing community, and significantly positive plant height - SRA relationship was found in the enclosure community. These findings demonstrated that limiting similarity based on niche theory was more important in structuring the enclosure community and that environmental filtering based on niche theory played a more important role in driving the grazing or mowing community. Only the factor of year significantly affected the functional evenness (FEve), and the lowest FEve in 2011 implied that the relatively lower precipitation could enhance the effect of limiting similarity on community assembly in the semi-arid grassland.",1,0,1,0,2

Sequencing data suggest considerable seed diversification between the seven homologous pre-miRNAs of miR-290-295 but it is not clear if all of the implied miR-290-295 seeds are also conserved in the human miR-371-373 cluster, which consists of only three homologous pre-miRNAs. By employing miRNA target reporters we show that most, if not all, seeds in miR-290-295 are represented in miR-371-373. In the mouse, pre-miR-290, pre-miR-292 and pre-miR-293 express subsets of the miRNA isoforms processed from the single human pre-miR-371. Comparison of the possible miR-290-295/miR-371-373 seed repertoires in placental mammals suggests a model for the evolution of this miRNA cluster family, which would be otherwise difficult to deduce based solely on pre-miRNA sequence comparisons. The conservation of co-expressed seeds that is characteristic of miR-290-295/miR-371-373 should be taken into account in models of the corresponding miRNA-target interaction networks. ",1,1,2,0,0
15059993,2004,"Levels of recombination vary among species, among chromosomes within species, and among regions within chromosomes in mammals. This heterogeneity may affect levels of diversity, efficiency of selection, and genome composition, as well as have practical consequences for the genetic mapping of traits. We compared the genetic maps to the genome sequence assemblies of rat, mouse, and human to estimate local recombination rates across these genomes. Humans have greater overall levels of recombination, as well as greater variance. In rat and mouse, the size of the chromosome and proximity to telomere have less effect on local recombination rate than in human. At the chromosome level, rat and mouse X chromosomes have the lowest recombination rates, whereas human chromosome X does not show the same pattern. In all species, local recombination rate is significantly correlated with several sequence variables, including GC%, CpG density, repetitive elements, and the neutral mutation rate, with some pronounced differences between species. Recombination rate in one species is not strongly correlated with the rate in another, when comparing homologous syntenic blocks of the genome. This comparative approach provides additional insight into the causes and consequences of genomic heterogeneity in recombination.",1,0,1,0,0

25571550,2014,"Right ventricular (RV) function is increasingly recognized to play an important role in the clinical status and long-term outcome in patients with congenital heart disease as well as ischemic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular dysfunction. However, quantification of RV characteristics and function are still challenging due to its complex morphology and its thin wall with coarse trabeculations. To assess RV functions quantitatively, establishing the patient-specific model from medical images is a prerequisite task. This study aims to develop a novel method for RV model reconstruction. Magnetic resonance images were acquired and preprocessed. Contours of right ventricle, right atrium and pulmonary artery were manually delineated at all slices and all time frames. The contour coordinates as well as the medical image specifications such as image pixel resolution and slick thickness were exported. The contours were transformed to the correct positions. Reorientation and matching were executed in between neighboring contours; extrapolation and interpolation were conducted upon all contours. After preprocessing, the more dense point set was reconstructed through a variational tool. A Delaunay-based tetrahedral mesh was generated on the region of interest. The weighted minimal surface model was used to describe RV surface. The graphcuts technique, i.e., max-flow/min-cut algorithm, was applied to minimize the energy defined by the model. The reconstructed surface was extracted from the mesh according to the mincut. Smoothing and remeshing were performed. The CPU time to reconstruct the model for one frame was approximately 2 minutes. In 10 consecutive subjects referred for cardiac MRI (80% female), right ventricular volumes were measured using our method against the commercial available CMRtools package. The results demonstrated that there was a significant correlation in end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes between our method and commercial software (r= 0.89 for end-diastolic volume and r=0.79 for end-systolic volume, both P<;0.0001). The time to obtain right ventricular volumes was shorter using our method than commercial one. In conclusion, a new method for right ventricle reconstruction has been developed. We envisage that this automatic modeling tool could be used by radiographer and cardiologists to assess the RV function in diverse heart diseases. ",1,1,2,0,0
18030340,2007,"The magnitude of negative selection on alleles involved in age-specific mortality decreases with age. This is the foundation of the evolutionary theory of senescence. Because of this decrease in negative selection with age, and because of the absence of reproduction after menopause, alleles involved in women's late-onset diseases are generally considered evolutionarily neutral. Recently, genetic and epidemiological data on alleles involved in late onset-diseases have become available. It is therefore timely to estimate selection on these alleles. Here, we estimate selection on BRCA1 alleles leading to susceptibility to late-onset breast and ovarian cancer. For this, we integrate estimates of the risk of developing a cancer for BRCA1-carriers into population genetics frameworks, and calculate selection coefficients on BRCA1 alleles for different demographic scenarios varying across the extent of human demography. We then explore the magnitude of negative selection on alleles leading to a diverse range of risk patterns, to capture a variety of late-onset diseases. We show that BRCA1 alleles may have been under significant negative selection during human history. Although the mean age of onset of the disease is long after menopause, variance in age of onset means that there are always enough cases occurring before the end of reproductive life to compromise the selective value of women carrying a susceptibility allele in BRCA1. This seems to be the case for an extended range of risk of onset functions varying both in mean and variance. This finding may explain the distribution of BRCA1 alleles' frequency, and also why alleles for many late-onset diseases, like certain familial forms of cancer, coronary artery diseases and Alzheimer dementia, are typically recent and rare. Finally, we discuss why the two most popular evolutionary theories of aging, mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy, may underestimate the effect of selection on survival at old ages.",1,1,9,0,0
19446455,2009,"BACKGROUND:
Candida species are microbial pathogens originally thought to be asexual, but several are now recognized as sexual or parasexual. Candida albicans, the most common fungus infecting humans, is an obligate diploid with a parasexual cycle involving mating, recombination, and genome reduction but no recognized meiosis. Others (C. lusitaniae, C. guilliermondii) are haploid, and their mating produces spores, suggestive of complete meiotic sexual cycles. However, comparative genomic analysis reveals that these species lack key meiotic components, including the recombinase Dmc1 and cofactors (Mei5/Sae3), synaptonemal-complex proteins (Zip1-Zip4/Hop1), and the crossover interference pathway (Msh4/5).
RESULTS:
Here we elucidate the structure and functions of the mating-type (MAT) locus and establish that C. lusitaniae undergoes meiosis during its sexual cycle. The MAT-encoded a2 (high-mobility group) and alpha1 (alpha domain) factors specify a and alpha cell identity, whereas the a1 homeodomain protein drives meiosis and sporulation and functions without its canonical heterodimeric partner, alpha2. Despite the apparent loss of meiotic genes, C. lusitaniae undergoes meiosis during sexual reproduction involving diploid intermediates, frequent SPO11-dependent recombination, and whole-genome reduction generating haploid progeny. The majority of meiotic progeny are euploid, but approximately one-third are diploid/aneuploid.
CONCLUSIONS:
The cell identity and meiotic pathways have been substantially rewired, and meiotic generation of both recombinant and aneuploid progeny may expand genetic diversity. These findings inform our understanding of sexual reproduction in pathogenic microbes and the evolutionary plasticity of the meiotic machinery, with implications for the sexual nature of C. albicans and the generation and consequences of aneuploidy in biology and medicine.

Such a vaccine is necessary because of the massive disease burden of malaria in the developing world, the global spread of drug resistance, and the difficulty of sustainable control of the mosquito vector. Animal models have shown the immunological feasibility of vaccines targeted against different stages of parasite development, and studies in human volunteers have shown that a recombinant protein vaccine can protect against challenge with the homologous strain of parasite. However, both natural and vaccine-induced immunity are hampered by the remarkable capacity of the parasites to vary critical antigenic structures; large field trials of a synthetic peptide vaccine gave equivocal results.

22673805,2012,"Inversion polymorphisms have occupied a privileged place in Drosophila genetic research since their discovery in the 1920s. Indeed, inversions seem to be nearly ubiquitous, and the majority of species that have been thoroughly surveyed have been found to be polymorphic for one or more chromosomal inversions. Despite enduring interest, however, inversions remain difficult to study because their effects are often cryptic, and few efficient assays have been developed. Even in Drosophila melanogaster, in which inversions can be reliably detected and have received considerable attention, the breakpoints of only three inversions have been characterized molecularly. Hence, inversion detection and assay design remain important unsolved problems. Here, we present a method for identification and local de novo assembly of inversion breakpoints using next-generation paired-end reads derived from D. melanogaster isofemale lines. PCR and cytological confirmations demonstrate that our method can reliably assemble inversion breakpoints, providing tools for future research on D. melanogaster inversions as well as a framework for detection and assay design of inversions and other chromosome aberrations in diverse taxa.",1,0,1,0,0

Atrial fibrillation after thoracic surgery is frequent and increases morbidity and mortality. A number of trials have investigated medical prophylaxis for the prevention of atrial fibrillation after surgery for lung cancer. However, the literature is diverse and hence difficult to review. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of reducing the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation by the use of medical prophylaxis in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer.
METHODS:
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials investigating prophylactic medical interventions to reduce the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation was performed.
RESULTS:
A total number of 10 trials were identified. A significant reduction in the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation was found with a relative risk of 0.53 (95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.67) and a number needed-to-treat of 8.5 (95% confidence interval, 6.4 to 13.3). Amiodarone was found to be the most effective prophylactic agent with a relative risk of 0.32 (95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.50) and a number needed-to-treat of 4.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.7 to 7.6) and regarded as safe, with no severe adverse events registered. The risk of atrial fibrillation was overall reduced from 25.1% to 13.4% (p < 0.001) and for amiodarone as a single therapy from 30.4% to 9.6% (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS:
Medical prophylaxis with calcium-channel blockers, magnesium sulfate, or amiodarone significantly reduces the risk of developing atrial fibrillation after lung reduction surgery. However, amiodarone and magnesium sulfate were the most effective and safest drugs causing no increased risk of adverse events.

17895384,2007,"Protein-ligand interactions, including protein-protein interactions, are ubiquitously essential in biological processes and also have important applications in biotechnology. A wide range of methodologies have been developed for quantitative analysis of protein-ligand interactions. However, most of them do not report direct functional/structural consequence of ligand binding. Instead they only detect the change of physical properties, such as fluorescence and refractive index, because of the colocalization of protein and ligand, and are susceptible to false positives. Thus, important information about the functional state of protein-ligand complexes cannot be obtained directly. Here we report a functional single-molecule binding assay that uses force spectroscopy to directly probe the functional consequence of ligand binding and report the functional state of protein-ligand complexes. As a proof of principle, we used protein G and the Fc fragment of IgG as a model system in this study. Binding of Fc to protein G does not induce major structural changes in protein G but results in significant enhancement of its mechanical stability. Using mechanical stability of protein G as an intrinsic functional reporter, we directly distinguished and quantified Fc-bound and Fc-free forms of protein G on a single-molecule basis and accurately determined their dissociation constant. This single-molecule functional binding assay is label-free, nearly background-free, and can detect functional heterogeneity, if any, among protein-ligand interactions. This methodology opens up avenues for studying protein-ligand interactions in a functional context, and we anticipate that it will find broad application in diverse protein-ligand systems.",1,0,1,0,0
27126520,2016,"The sedimentary record, and associated micropalaeontological proxies, is one tool that has been employed to quantify a region's tropical cyclone history.

In this study, we examine microfossil assemblages before and after a known tropical cyclone event (Cyclone Hamish) with the aim to better resolve the characteristics of this known signal. Our results identify no allochthonous material associated with Cyclone Hamish. Instead, using a swathe of statistical tools typical of ecological studies but rarely employed in the geosciences, we identify new, previously unidentified, signal types. These signals include a homogenising effect, with the level of differentiation between sample sites greatly reduced immediately following Cyclone Hamish, and discernible shifts in assemblage diversity.

19890327,2009,"Glass formation in colloidal suspensions has many of the hallmarks of glass formation in molecular materials. For hard-sphere colloids, which interact only as a result of excluded volume, phase behaviour is controlled by volume fraction, phi; an increase in phi drives the system towards its glassy state, analogously to a decrease in temperature, T, in molecular systems. When phi increases above phi* approximately 0.53, the viscosity starts to increase significantly, and the system eventually moves out of equilibrium at the glass transition, phi(g) approximately 0.58, where particle crowding greatly restricts structural relaxation. The large particle size makes it possible to study both structure and dynamics with light scattering and imaging; colloidal suspensions have therefore provided considerable insight into the glass transition. However, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions do not exhibit the same diversity of behaviour as molecular glasses. This is highlighted by the wide variation in behaviour observed for the viscosity or structural relaxation time, tau(alpha), when the glassy state is approached in supercooled molecular liquids. This variation is characterized by the unifying concept of fragility, which has spurred the search for a 'universal' description of dynamic arrest in glass-forming liquids. For 'fragile' liquids, tau(alpha) is highly sensitive to changes in T, whereas non-fragile, or 'strong', liquids show a much lower T sensitivity. In contrast, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions are restricted to fragile behaviour, as determined by their phi dependence, ultimately limiting their utility in the study of the glass transition. Here we show that deformable colloidal particles, when studied through their concentration dependence at fixed temperature, do exhibit the same variation in fragility as that observed in the T dependence of molecular liquids at fixed volume. Their fragility is dictated by elastic properties on the scale of individual colloidal particles. Furthermore, we find an equivalent effect in molecular systems, where elasticity directly reflects fragility. Colloidal suspensions may thus provide new insight into glass formation in molecular systems.",1,0,1,0,0
1682066,1991,"Isolated adult canine ventricular myocytes were used to study the role of compartmentation of cAMP in the diverse functional responses to various drugs that elevate cAMP. Myocytes presented with the beta-agonist isoproterenol accumulated cAMP with a half maximally effective concentration (EC50) of 3.55 x 10(-8) M. Approximately 45% of the total cAMP was recovered in the particulate fraction of digitonin-lysed myocytes under these conditions. With phosphodiesterase inhibition (10 microM isobutylmethylxanthine), isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production was up to 3.4-fold greater, but the proportion of total cAMP residing in the particulate fraction declined to less than 20%. Similar results were obtained with forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase. Treatment with isoproterenol shortened the duration at 50% maximum peak height (T 1/2) and increased the peak fluorescence ratio of electrically triggered single-cell free Ca2+ transients in fura-2-loaded canine myocytes. Isoproterenol dose-response curves gave EC50 values of 1.7 x 10(-9) and 4.4 x 10(-9) M for effects on T 1/2 and peak height, respectively. Alterations in peak height and T 1/2 of Ca2+ transients also showed a dose dependency on isobutylmethylxanthine and forskolin. Comparison of myocyte cAMP content with the corresponding changes in free Ca2+ transients demonstrated a close correlation between particulate cAMP and the extent of shortening or increase in peak height of the fura-2 Ca2+ transients (r = 0.92 for each). However, when these two parameters were plotted as a function of total cAMP, the resulting curves were nonlinear and divergent for each agent tested. The results support the hypothesis that differences in responses to agents that augment cAMP can be explained in part by compartmentation of cAMP. Furthermore, Ca2+ mobilization seems to be most affected by cAMP located in the particulate compartment of canine cardiac myocytes.",1,1,2,0,0

Given the great efforts put into the strategic objective of reducing the proportion of HIV-infected patients that are undiagnosed, the aim of the present study was to review the temporal trends between 1997 and 2016 for median estimates of infection duration and median CD4 count at diagnosis for the main patient origins in French Guiana.
METHODS:
CD4 cell count at HIV sero-conversion and square root of CD4 cell decline were obtained using the CD4 decline in a cohort of HIV-infected persons in the UK, fitting random effect (slope and intercept) multilevel linear regression models. Multivariate analysis used robust regression for modeling the delay between estimated HIV seroconversion and diagnosis and quantile regression for CD4 at HIV diagnosis.
RESULTS:
The median interval between the estimated HIV seroconversion and HIV diagnosis was 8 years for patients fromBrazil, 4.5 years for those from Haiti, 6.6 years for those from Suriname, 3.3 years for patients from Guyana, and 3.1 years for French patients. A simple robust regression model with French patients as reference group adjusting for sex and age at the time of diagnosis showed that the interval was significantly longer for Brazilian (β = +3.7 years, P = 0.001), Surinamese (β = +4.2 years, P<0.0001), Haitian origins (β = +1.5 years, P = 0.049) but not for those originating from Guyana (β = -0.03 years, P = 0.9); Men independently had a longer interval than women (β = +3.5 years, P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS:
Despite great efforts in French Guiana regarding HIV testing both in terms of diversification and intensification we still need to tailor the offer to better reach the communities in need. These results should help authorities scale up and optimize initiatives to reduce the proportion of patients who are unaware of their infection. They also raise the question of the role of stigma and discrimination as a barrier to HIV testing in small communities, and further emphasize the importance of reducing it.

From a fetal brain cDNA library, we isolated a cDNA of 2489 base pairs (bp) encoding a novel human BTB domain-containing protein named BTBD10. The cDNA contained an open-reading frame (ORF) of 1428 bp encoding a putative 475-amino acid (aa) protein. The BTBD10 gene was located on human chromosome 11p15.2 and consisted of nine exons spanning about 75.2 kilobase pairs (kb) of the human genome. The cDNA microarray analysis showed that BTBD10 was down-regulated in all 18 glioma samples.

The subcellular localization result revealed that BTBD10 was located specifically in the nucleus of HEK293 and COS7 cell lines, suggesting that it may function in transcriptional regulation. The different expression patterns of BTBD10 in different grades of glioma versus normal brain were also examined by RT-PCR and Northern blot.

Prevalence of M. genitalium and associated genotypic markers of macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance among men symptomatic of urethritis were investigated. Genetic diversity of M. genitalium populations was determined to infer whether findings were applicable beyond our setting.

Nine of 22 (41%; 95% CI, 20%-62%) patients with M. genitalium were infected with DLSTs possessing genotypic macrolide resistance and 1 patient was infected with a DLST having genotypic fluoroquinolone resistance. Typing assigned M. genitalium DLSTs to 2 major clusters, broadly distributed among previously typed international strains. Genotypic macrolide resistance was spread within these 2 clusters.
CONCLUSIONS:
 Mycoplasma genitalium is a frequent undiagnosed cause of NGU in this population with rates of macrolide resistance higher than those previously documented. Current guidelines for routine testing and empirical treatment of NGU should be modified to reduce treatment failure of NGU and the development of further resistance.

32045667,2020,"Human antigen R (HuR), also known as HuA and embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like 1 (ELAVL1), is a ubiquitously expressed RNA binding protein and functions as an RNA regulator and mediates the expression of various proteins by diverse post-transcriptional mechanisms. HuR has been well characterized in the inflammatory responses and in the development of various cancers. The importance of HuR-mediated roles in cell signaling, inflammation, fibrogenesis and cancer development in the liver has attracted a great deal of attention. However, there is still a substantial gap between the current understanding of the potential roles of HuR in the progression of liver disease and whether HuR can be targeted for the treatment of liver diseases. In this review, we introduce the function and mechanistic characterization of HuR, and then focus on the physiopathological roles of HuR in the development of different liver diseases, including hepatic inflammation, alcoholic liver diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, viral hepatitis, liver fibrosis and liver cancers. We also summarize existing approaches targeting HuR function. In conclusion, although characterizing the liver-specific HuR function and demonstrating the multi-level regulative networks of HuR in the liver are still required, emerging evidence supports the notion that HuR represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic liver diseases.",1,0,1,0,1
19936246,2009,"Mutations affecting the heritable maintenance of epigenetic states in maize identify multiple small RNA biogenesis factors including NRPD1, the largest subunit of the presumed maize Pol IV holoenzyme. Here we show that mutations defining the required to maintain repression7 locus identify a second RNA polymerase subunit related to Arabidopsis NRPD2a, the sole second largest subunit shared between Arabidopsis Pol IV and Pol V. A phylogenetic analysis shows that, in contrast to representative eudicots, grasses have retained duplicate loci capable of producing functional NRPD2-like proteins, which is indicative of increased RNA polymerase diversity in grasses relative to eudicots. Together with comparisons of rmr7 mutant plant phenotypes and their effects on the maintenance of epigenetic states with parallel analyses of NRPD1 defects, our results imply that maize utilizes multiple functional NRPD2-like proteins. Despite the observation that RMR7/NRPD2, like NRPD1, is required for the accumulation of most siRNAs, our data indicate that different Pol IV isoforms play distinct roles in the maintenance of meiotically-heritable epigenetic information in the grasses.",1,0,1,0,0
12727828,2003,"Interactions between the Bcr/Abl kinase inhibitor STI571 (Gleevec, imatinib mesylate) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) have been examined in STI571-sensitive and -resistant Bcr/Abl(+) human leukemia cells (K562 and LAMA 84). Cotreatment of K562 cells with 250 nM imatinib mesylate and 2.0 micro M suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) for 24 h, exposures that were minimally toxic alone, resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial damage (e.g., cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor release), caspase activation, and apoptosis. Similar events were observed in other Bcr/Abl(+) cells (i.e., LAMA 84), and in cells exposed to STI571 in combination with the HDI sodium butyrate. Coexposure of cells to HDIs in conjunction with STI571 resulted in multiple perturbations in signaling and cell cycle-regulatory proteins, including down-regulation of Raf, phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phospho-Akt, phospho-signal transducers and activators of transcription 5, cyclin D1, and Mcl-1, accompanied by dephosphorylation and cleavage of retinoblastoma protein and a striking increase in phosphorylation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase. Coexposure of Bcr/Abl(+) cells to STI571 also blocked SAHA-mediated induction of p21(CIP1) and resulted in down-regulation of Bcr/Abl protein expression. STI571 and SAHA also interacted synergistically to induce apoptosis in STI571-resistant K562 and LAMA 84 cells that display increased Bcr/Abl protein expression. Lastly, inducible expression of a constitutively active MEK1/2 construct significantly attenuated SAHA/STI571-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells, implicating disruption of the Raf/MEK/ERK axis in synergistic antileukemic effects of this drug combination. Together, these findings indicate that combined exposure of Bcr/Abl(+) cells to the kinase inhibitor STI571 and HDIs leads to diverse perturbations in signaling and cell cycle-regulatory proteins, associated with a marked increase in mitochondrial damage and cell death. They also raise the possibility that this strategy may be effective in some Bcr/Abl(+) cells that are resistant to STI571 through increased Bcr/Abl expression.",1,0,1,0,0

To improve measurements of pollinator performance underlying such predictions, we surveyed visitation frequency, pollinator effectiveness (pollen deposition ability) and pollinator importance (the product of visitation frequency and effectiveness) of flower visitors in a diverse Mediterranean flower meadow. With these data we constructed the largest pollinator importance network to date and compared it with the corresponding visitation network to estimate the specialisation of the community with greater precision. Visitation frequencies at the community level were positively correlated with the amount of pollen deposited during individual visits, though rarely correlated at lower taxonomic resolution. Bees had the highest levels of pollinator effectiveness, with Apis, Andrena, Lasioglossum and Osmiini bees being the most effective visitors to a number of plant species.

Most studies have reported the prevalence of HAdV-41 and focused on its epidemiologic characteristics. In this study, seventeen samples were identified as HAdV-41 out of 273 fecal specimens from children with acute diarrhea in Shanghai. Five isolates were isolated and subjected to whole genome sequencing and analysis to characterize the genetic variation and evolution. Full genome analysis revealed low genetic variation (99.07-99.92% identity) among the isolates, and InDels are observed in the E2A gene and the hexon gene compared to the reference strain NIVD103. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all isolates mainly formed two genome-type clusters but with incongruence in the trees of whole genomes and individual genes. The recombination breakpoints of the five isolates were inferred by the Recombination Detection Program (RDP) and varied in the number and location of the recombination events, indicating different evolution origins. Overall, our study highlights the genetic diversity of HAdV-41 isolates circulating in Shanghai, which may have evolved from inter-strain recombination.",1,1,3,0,0
25635682,2015,"In the period between 400 to 800 AD, also known as the period of the Barbarian invasions, intense migration is documented in the historical record of Europe. However, little is known about the demographic impact of these historical movements, potentially ranging from negligible to substantial. As a pilot study in a broader project on Medieval Europe, we sampled 102 specimens from 5 burial sites in Northwestern Italy, archaeologically classified as belonging to Lombards or Longobards, a Germanic people ruling over a vast section of the Italian peninsula from 568 to 774. We successfully amplified and typed the mitochondrial hypervariable region I (HVR-I) of 28 individuals. Comparisons of genetic diversity with other ancient populations and haplotype networks did not suggest that these samples are heterogeneous, and hence allowed us to jointly compare them with three isolated contemporary populations, and with a modern sample of a large city, representing a control for the effects of recent immigration. We then generated by serial coalescent simulations 16 millions of genealogies, contrasting a model of genealogical continuity with one in which the contemporary samples are genealogically independent from the medieval sample. Analyses by Approximate Bayesian Computation showed that the latter model fits the data in most cases, with one exception, Trino Vercellese, in which the evidence was compatible with persistence up to the present time of genetic features observed among this early medieval population. We conclude that it is possible, in general, to detect evidence of genealogical ties between medieval and specific modern populations. However, only seldom did mitochondrial DNA data allow us to reject with confidence either model tested, which indicates that broader analyses, based on larger assemblages of samples and genetic markers, are needed to understand in detail the effects of medieval migration.

This study examined the relative perceived effectiveness of 30 antidrug public service announcements (PSAs) and assessed the extent to which judgments of effectiveness are related to judgments of realism, amount learned, and positive and negative emotional responses.
METHODS:
Data were obtained from 3608 students in grades 5 through 12 in 10 schools. The ethnically diverse sample was 50.8% male. Students in 5 experimental conditions viewed sets of 6 antidrug PSAs and filled out a brief evaluation questionnaire following each PSA. Those in the control condition viewed a non-drug-related television program.
RESULTS:
The relative perceived effectiveness of the 30 PSAs varied considerably. Sixteen were rated as significantly more effective, and 6 as significantly less effective, than the control program. Relative rated effectiveness was highly related to realism (r =.87), amount learned (r =.88), negative emotion (r =.87), and positive emotion (r = -.35).
CONCLUSIONS:
Evaluative research is necessary to prevent broadcast of PSAs that could have a negative impact. PSAs should point out the negative consequences of drug use behavior rather than telling adolescents to ""just say no.""

The RBTN proteins belong to the LIM family which comprises proteins with one, two or three cysteine-rich LIM domains, sometimes together with homeodomains or protein kinase domains. The RBTN1 and RBTN2 proteins comprise only tandem LIM domains. We report that RBTN1 and RBTN2 proteins are capable of supporting transcriptional transactivation of specific reporter genes in transfection assays. The results, using intact proteins or fusions with the homeodomain of the heterologous protein Isl-1, show that this transcriptional activation ability resides in the NH2-terminal parts of both proteins. The use of yeast assays with RBTN2 shows that RBTN2 forms homodimers and that the NH2-terminal 27 amino acids are sufficient to facilitate transcriptional transactivation. These data expand the functional diversity of the LIM-domain protein family and they augment the previously defined relationship between chromosomal translocations and transcriptional activation.",1,0,1,0,0
32756585,2020,"BACKGROUND:
Options to increase the ease of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response are needed. Self-collection of diagnostic specimens at home offers an avenue to allow people to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or immune response without traveling to a clinic or laboratory. Before this study, survey respondents indicated willingness to self-collect specimens for COVID-related tests, but hypothetical willingness can differ from post-collection acceptability after participants collect specimens.
METHODS:
153 US adults were enrolled in a study of the willingness and feasibility of patients to self-collect three diagnostic specimens (saliva, oropharyngeal swab (OPS) and dried blood spot (DBS) card) while observed by a clinician through a telehealth session. After the specimens were collected, 148 participants participated in a survey about the acceptability of the collection, packing and shipping process, and their confidence in the samples collected for COVID-related laboratory testing.
RESULTS:
A large majority of participants (>84%) reported that collecting, packing and shipping of saliva, OPS, and DBS specimens were acceptable. Nearly nine in 10 (87%) reported being confident or very confident that the specimens they collected were sufficient for laboratory analysis.There were no differences in acceptability for any specimen type, packing and shipping, or confidence in samples, by gender, age, race/ethnicity, or educational level.
CONCLUSIONS:
Self-collection of specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing, and preparing and shipping specimens for analysis, were acceptable in a diverse group of US adults. Further refinement of materials and instructions to support self-collection of saliva, OPS and DBS specimens for COVID-related testing is needed.

Retinal-vessel calibre measured by the models and by expert human graders showed high agreement, with overall intraclass correlation coefficients of between 0.82 and 0.95. The models performed comparably to or better than expert graders in associations between measurements of retinal-vessel calibre and CVD risk factors, including blood pressure, body-mass index, total cholesterol and glycated-haemoglobin levels.

9106541,1997,"As the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in North America, cystic fibrosis (CF) is an obvious candidate for general population carrier screening. Although the identification of the causative gene has made detection of asymptomatic carriers possible, the extreme heterogeneity of its mutations has limited the sensitivity of the available DNA screening tests and has called into question their utility when they are applied to patients with no family history of the disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the technical feasibility, patient acceptance and understanding, and psychosocial impact of large-scale CF carrier screening in an ethnically diverse pregnant population. A total of 4,739 pregnant women attending prenatal clinics located in both an academic medical center and a large HMO were invited in person to participate. Of this group, 3,543 received CF instruction and assessments of knowledge and mood, and 3,192 underwent DNA testing for the six most common CF mutations, by means of a noninvasive PCR-based reverse-dot-blot method. Overall participation rates (ranging from 53% at the HMO to 77% at the academic center) and consent rates for DNA testing after CF instruction (>98%) exceeded those of most other American studies. The PCR-based screening method worked efficiently on large numbers of samples, and 55 carriers and one at-risk couple were identified. Understanding of residual risk, anxiety levels, and overall satisfaction with the program were acceptable across all ethnic groups. Our strategy of approaching a motivated pregnant population in person with a rapid and noninvasive testing method may provide a practical model for developing a larger CF screening program targeting appropriate high-risk groups at the national level, and may also serve as a paradigm for population-based screening of other genetically heterogeneous disorders in the future.",1,1,5,2,4
26838501,2016,"BACKGROUND:
Recent advances in transcriptome sequencing have enabled the discovery of thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) across many species. Though several lncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in diverse biological processes, the functions and mechanisms of most lncRNAs remain unknown. Two significant obstacles lie between transcriptome sequencing and functional characterization of lncRNAs: identifying truly non-coding genes from de novo reconstructed transcriptomes, and prioritizing the hundreds of resulting putative lncRNAs for downstream experimental interrogation.
RESULTS:
We present slncky, a lncRNA discovery tool that produces a high-quality set of lncRNAs from RNA-sequencing data and further uses evolutionary constraint to prioritize lncRNAs that are likely to be functionally important. Our automated filtering pipeline is comparable to manual curation efforts and more sensitive than previously published computational approaches. Furthermore, we developed a sensitive alignment pipeline for aligning lncRNA loci and propose new evolutionary metrics relevant for analyzing sequence and transcript evolution. Our analysis reveals that evolutionary selection acts in several distinct patterns, and uncovers two notable classes of intergenic lncRNAs: one showing strong purifying selection on RNA sequence and another where constraint is restricted to the regulation but not the sequence of the transcript.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our results highlight that lncRNAs are not a homogenous class of molecules but rather a mixture of multiple functional classes with distinct biological mechanism and/or roles. Our novel comparative methods for lncRNAs reveals 233 constrained lncRNAs out of tens of thousands of currently annotated transcripts, which we make available through the slncky Evolution Browser.

27229929,2016,"BACKGROUND:
Perturbed genotypes in cancer can now be identified by whole genome sequencing of large number of diverse tumor samples, and observed gene mutations can be used for prognosis and classification of cancer subtypes. Although mutations in a few causative genes are directly linked to key signaling pathways perturbation, a global understanding of how known cancer genes drive oncogenesis in human is difficult to assess.
METHODS:
We collected available information about mutated genes in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Validated human protein interactions (PPI) were collected from IntAct, HPRD and BioGRID interactomics databases, or obtained using yeast two-hybrid screening assay.
RESULTS:
We have mapped interconnections between 116 cancer census gene products associated with ALL. Combining protein-protein interactions data and cancer-specific gene mutations information, we observed that 63 ALL-gene products are interconnected and identified 37 human proteins interacting with at least 2 ALL-gene products. We highlighted exclusive and coexistence genetic alterations in key signaling pathways including the PI3K/AKT and the NOTCH pathways. We then used different cell lines and reporter assay systems to validate the involvement of EXT1 in the Notch pathway.
CONCLUSION:
We propose that novel ALL-gene candidates can be identified based on their functional association with well-known cancer genes. We identified EXT1, a gene not previously linked to ALL via mutations, as a common interactor of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 regulating the NOTCH pathway in an FBXW7-dependend manner.

We examined whether past-year suicidality among sexual-minority adolescents was more common in neighborhoods with a higher prevalence of hate crimes targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals.
METHODS:
Participants' data came from a racially/ethnically diverse population-based sample of 9th- through 12th-grade public school students in Boston, Massachusetts (n = 1292). Of these, 108 (8.36%) reported a minority sexual orientation. We obtained data on LGBT hate crimes involving assaults or assaults with battery between 2005 and 2008 from the Boston Police Department and linked the data to the adolescent's residential address.
RESULTS:
Sexual-minority youths residing in neighborhoods with higher rates of LGBT assault hate crimes were significantly more likely to report suicidal ideation (P = .013) and suicide attempts (P = .006), than were those residing in neighborhoods with lower LGBT assault hate crime rates. We observed no relationships between overall neighborhood-level violent and property crimes and suicidality among sexual-minority adolescents (P > .05), providing evidence for specificity of the results to LGBT assault hate crimes.

22472011,2012,"BACKGROUND:
Common measures of surgical quality are 30-day morbidity and mortality, which poorly describe breast cancer surgical quality with extremely low morbidity and mortality rates. Several national quality programs have collected additional surgical quality measures; however, program participation is voluntary and results may not be generalizable to all surgeons. We developed the Breast Cancer Surgical Outcomes (BRCASO) database to capture meaningful breast cancer surgical quality measures among a non-voluntary sample, and study variation in these measures across providers, facilities, and health plans. This paper describes our study protocol, data collection methods, and summarizes the strengths and limitations of these data.
METHODS:
We included 4524 women ≥18 years diagnosed with breast cancer between 2003-2008. All women with initial breast cancer surgery performed by a surgeon employed at the University of Vermont or three Cancer Research Network (CRN) health plans were eligible for inclusion. From the CRN institutions, we collected electronic administrative data including tumor registry information, Current Procedure Terminology codes for breast cancer surgeries, surgeons, surgical facilities, and patient demographics. We supplemented electronic data with medical record abstraction to collect additional pathology and surgery detail. All data were manually abstracted at the University of Vermont.
RESULTS:
The CRN institutions pre-filled 30% (22 out of 72) of elements using electronic data. The remaining elements, including detailed pathology margin status and breast and lymph node surgeries, required chart abstraction. The mean age was 61 years (range 20-98 years); 70% of women were diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, 20% with ductal carcinoma in situ, and 10% with invasive lobular carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS:
The BRCASO database is one of the largest, multi-site research resources of meaningful breast cancer surgical quality data in the United States. Assembling data from electronic administrative databases and manual chart review balanced efficiency with high-quality, unbiased data collection. Using the BRCASO database, we will evaluate surgical quality measures including mastectomy rates, positive margin rates, and partial mastectomy re-excision rates among a diverse, non-voluntary population of patients, providers, and facilities.

Approximately one third of all SLCs belong to the evolutionary conserved and functionally diverse Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS). Here, we studied the orphan proteins, MFSD4A and MFSD9, which are atypical SLCs of MFS type. Hidden Markov Models were used to identify orthologues in several vertebrates, and human MFSD4A and MFSD9 share high sequence identity with their identified orthologues. MFSD4A and MFSD9 also shared more than 20% sequence identity with other phylogenetically related SLC and MFSD proteins, allowing new family clustering. Homology models displayed 12 transmembrane segments for both proteins, which were predicted to fold into a transporter-shaped structure. Furthermore, we analysed the location of MFSD4A and MFSD9 in adult mouse brain using immunohistochemistry, showing abundant neuronal protein staining. As MFSD4A and MFSD9 are plausible transporters expressed in food regulatory brain areas, we monitored transcriptional changes in several mouse brain areas after 24 hours food-deprivation and eight weeks of high-fat diet, showing that both genes were affected by altered food intake in vivo. In conclusion, we propose MFSD4A and MFSD9 to be novel transporters, belonging to disparate SLC families.

The wide and vigorous outer-reef system of French Polynesia presents a rare opportunity to assess ecosystem resilience to disturbances at a large-scale equivalent to the size of Europe. In this purpose, we analysed long-term data on coral community dynamics and combine the mixed-effects regression framework with a set of functional response models to evaluate coral recovery trajectories. Analyses of 14 years data across 17 reefs allowed estimating impacts of a cyclone, bleaching event and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak, which generated divergence and asynchrony in coral community trajectory. We evaluated reef resilience by quantifying levels of exposure, degrees of vulnerability, and descriptors of recovery of coral communities in the face of disturbances. Our results show an outstanding rate of coral recovery, with a systematic return to the pre-disturbance state within only 5 to 10 years. Differences in the impacts of disturbances among reefs and in the levels of vulnerability of coral taxa to these events resulted in diverse recovery patterns. The consistent recovery of coral communities, and convergence toward pre-disturbance community structures, reveals that the processes that regulate ecosystem recovery still prevail in French Polynesia.",1,0,1,0,3

In this study, we use spatially explicit remotely sensed sea ice concentration and high-resolution terrestrial productivity estimates (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) across the Svalbard Archipelago to describe local/sub-regional and large-scale components of sea ice/terrestrial productivity coupling. Whereas the local/sub-regional component is attributed to sea breeze (cold air advection from ice-covered ocean onto adjacent land during the growing season), the large-scale component might reflect co-variability of sea ice and tundra productivity due to a common forcing, such as large-scale atmospheric circulation (North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO).

Using MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), we investigated greenness trend in the Greater Antilles Caribbean during 2000-2015, and analyzed trend of vegetation patches without LCLUC to give prominence to climate impacts. We hypothesized that night warming and heavy cloudiness would reduce EVI in this mountainous tropical region. Over the 15 years, EVI decreased significantly in Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, but increased in Cuba partly due to its strong reforestation. Haiti had the largest decreasing trend because of continuous deforestation for charcoals. After LCLUC was excluded, EVI trend still varied greatly, decreasing in the windward but increasing in the leeward of Puerto Rico. Nighttime warming reinforced by spatially heterogeneous cloudiness was found to significantly and negatively correlate with EVI trend, and explained the spatial pattern of the latter. Although cooled daytime and increased rainfall might enhance EVI, nighttime warming dominated the climate impacts and differentiated the EVI trend.",1,0,1,0,10
20090919,2010,"Previous studies in Argentina have documented a general prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection close to 2%. In addition, a high prevalence of HCV has been recently reported in different Argentinean small rural communities. In this work, we performed a study aimed at analyzing the origins and diversification patterns of an HCV outbreak in Wheelwright, a small rural town located in Santa Fe province (Argentina).A total of 89 out of 1814 blood samples collected from people living in Wheelwright, were positive for HCV infection. The highest prevalence (4.9%) was observed in people older than 50 years, with the highest level for the group aged between 70-79 years (22%). The RFLP analyses showed that 91% of the positive samples belonged to the HCV-1b genotype. The E1/E2 and NS5B genes were sequenced, and their phylogenetic analysis showed that the HCV-1b sequences from Wheelwright were monophyletic. Bayesian coalescent-based methods were used to estimate substitution rates and time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA). The mean estimated substitution rates and the tMRCA for E1/E2 with and without HVR1 and NS5B were 7.41E-03 s/s/y and 61 years, 5.05E-03 s/s/y and 58 years and 3.24E-03 s/s/y and 53 years, respectively. In summary, the tMRCA values, the demographic model with constant population size, and the fact that the highest prevalence of infection was observed in elder people support the hypothesis that the HCV-1b introduction in Wheelwright initially occurred at least five decades ago and that the early epidemic was characterized by a fast rate of virus transmission. The epidemic seems to have been controlled later on down to the standard transmission rates observed elsewhere.",1,1,3,0,2
10226031,1999,"Human EB1 is a highly conserved protein that binds to the carboxyl terminus of the human adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein [1], a domain of APC that is commonly deleted in colorectal neoplasia [2]. EB1 belongs to a family of microtubule-associated proteins that includes Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mal3 [3] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bim1p [4]. Bim1p appears to regulate the timing of cytokinesis as demonstrated by a genetic interaction with Act5, a component of the yeast dynactin complex [5]. Whereas the predominant function of the dynactin complex in yeast appears to be in positioning the mitotic spindle [6], in animal cells, dynactin has been shown to function in diverse processes, including organelle transport, formation of the mitotic spindle, and perhaps cytokinesis [7] [8] [9] [10]. Here, we demonstrate that human EB1 can be coprecipitated with p150(Glued), a member of the dynactin protein complex. EB1 was also found associated with the intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein (CDIC) and with dynamitin (p50), another component of the dynactin complex, but not with dynein heavy chain, in a complex that sedimented at approximately 5S in a sucrose density gradient. The association of EB1 with members of the dynactin complex was independent of APC and was preserved in the absence of an intact microtubule cytoskeleton. The molecular interaction of EB1 with members of the dynactin complex and with CDIC may be important for microtubule-based processes.",1,0,1,0,0
26619199,2015,"The human gut microbiota is impacted by host nutrition and health status and therefore represents a potentially adaptive phenotype influenced by metabolic and immune constraints. Previous studies contrasting rural populations in developing countries to urban industrialized ones have shown that industrialization is strongly correlated with patterns in human gut microbiota; however, we know little about the relative contribution of factors such as climate, diet, medicine, hygiene practices, host genetics, and parasitism. Here, we focus on fine-scale comparisons of African rural populations in order to (i) contrast the gut microbiota of populations inhabiting similar environments but having different traditional subsistence modes and either shared or distinct genetic ancestry, and (ii) examine the relationship between gut parasites and bacterial communities. Characterizing the fecal microbiota of Pygmy hunter-gatherers as well as Bantu individuals from both farming and fishing populations in Southwest Cameroon, we found that the gut parasite Entamoeba is significantly correlated with microbiome composition and diversity. We show that across populations, colonization by this protozoa can be predicted with 79% accuracy based on the composition of an individual's gut microbiota, and that several of the taxa most important for distinguishing Entamoeba absence or presence are signature taxa for autoimmune disorders. We also found gut communities to vary significantly with subsistence mode, notably with some taxa previously shown to be enriched in other hunter-gatherers groups (in Tanzania and Peru) also discriminating hunter-gatherers from neighboring farming or fishing populations in Cameroon.

28107561,2017,"BACKGROUND:
Beta-blockers refer to a mixed group of drugs with diverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. They have shown long-term beneficial effects on mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) when used in people with heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, the benefit of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension without compelling indications is controversial. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review initially published in 2007 and updated in 2012.
OBJECTIVES:
To assess the effects of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality endpoints in adults with hypertension.
SEARCH METHODS:
The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to June 2016: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked reference lists of relevant reviews, and reference lists of studies potentially eligible for inclusion in this review, and also searched the the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 06 July 2015.
SELECTION CRITERIA:
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least one year of duration, which assessed the effects of beta-blockers compared to placebo or other drugs, as first-line therapy for hypertension, on mortality and morbidity in adults.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
We selected studies and extracted data in duplicate, resolving discrepancies by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and conducted fixed-effect or random-effects meta-analyses, as appropriate. We also used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. GRADE classifies the certainty of evidence as high (if we are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect), moderate (if the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect), low (if the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect), and very low (if we are very uncertain about the estimate of effect).
MAIN RESULTS:
Thirteen RCTs met inclusion criteria. They compared beta-blockers to placebo (4 RCTs, 23,613 participants), diuretics (5 RCTs, 18,241 participants), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs: 4 RCTs, 44,825 participants), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (3 RCTs, 10,828 participants). These RCTs were conducted between the 1970s and 2000s and most of them had a high risk of bias resulting from limitations in study design, conduct, and data analysis. There were 40,245 participants taking beta-blockers, three-quarters of them taking atenolol. We found no outcome trials involving the newer vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g. nebivolol).There was no difference in all-cause mortality between beta-blockers and placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11), diuretics or RAS inhibitors, but it was higher for beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14). The evidence on mortality was of moderate-certainty for all comparisons.Total CVD was lower for beta-blockers compared to placebo (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97; low-certainty evidence), a reflection of the decrease in stroke (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; low-certainty evidence) since there was no difference in coronary heart disease (CHD: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of beta-blockers on CVD was worse than that of CCBs (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.29; moderate-certainty evidence), but was not different from that of diuretics (moderate-certainty) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty). In addition, there was an increase in stroke in beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.40; moderate-certainty evidence) and RAS inhibitors (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.53; moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference in CHD between beta-blockers and diuretics (low-certainty evidence), CCBs (moderate-certainty evidence) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty evidence). In the single trial involving participants aged 65 years and older, atenolol was associated with an increased CHD incidence compared to diuretics (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.32). Participants taking beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than participants taking RAS inhibitors (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.54; moderate-certainty evidence), but there was little or no difference with placebo, diuretics or CCBs (low-certainty evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
Most outcome RCTs on beta-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension have high risk of bias. Atenolol was the beta-blocker most used. Current evidence suggests that initiating treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers leads to modest CVD reductions and little or no effects on mortality. These beta-blocker effects are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs. Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different subtypes of beta-blockers or whether beta-blockers have differential effects on younger and older people.

25993053,2015,"The Arab world, which consists of the 22 member states of the Arab League, is undergoing a rapid transition in demographics, including fertility, mortality, and migration. Comprising a distinctive geographic region spread across West Asia and North East Africa and unified by the Arabic language, these states share common values and characteristics despite having diverse economic and political conditions. The demographic lag (high fertility and low mortality) that characterizes the Arab world is unique, but the present trend of declining fertility, combined with the relatively low mortality, brings about significant changes in its population size. This research aimed to: (i) assess the population growth in the Arab world over 3 time periods, (ii) explore its components, and (iii) understand its public health impact. Data from the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau for 3 time periods (1992, 2002, and 2012) in 21 countries of the Arab world were analyzed by dividing them into four geographic sectors, namely, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), West Asia, Maghreb, and the Nile Valley African Horn. The population of the Arab world has grown considerably due to both natural growth and migration. The immigration is pronounced, especially into resource-intensive GCC nations, not only from East Asian and Central African countries but also from resource-thrifty (limited-resource) Arab nations. The migrations within, as well as outside, the Arab world reveal an interesting demographic phenomenon that requires further research: migration flows and trends. However, the transformations in public health statistics related to mortality-the impact of demographic changes-depict a new era in the Arab world. ",1,0,1,1,21
32877726,2020,"With the development of biomedicine and materials science, the emerging research of iron-based nanoplatforms (INPs) have provided a bright future for tumor theranostics. Thanks to its excellent biocompatibility and diverse application potential, some INPs have successfully transformed from the laboratory to the clinic and market, making it one of the most successful nanoplatforms. Further investigations associated with its enormous biomedical potential is continuing, and new features of them are being demonstrated. The discovery of ferroptosis therapy opens up new avenue for the applications of INPs in tumor therapy, which is attracting tremendous attention from worldwide. It is well established that some of the INPs are capable of triggering the tumor cell ferroptosis efficiently, accelerating the tumor cell death process. Combined with anti-tumor drugs or other tumor therapy approaches, the INPs-induced ferroptosis are expected to break the bottleneck in the treatment of drug-resistant malignant tumors. In addition, other applications of INPs in tumor theranostics field are still active. Featured with the catalase-like ability, INPs were also well documented to reverse the tumor hypoxia as nanozymes, assisting and enhancing the oxygen-consuming tumor therapy approaches. And the unique magnetic property of INPs endow it with great potential in tumor diagnosis, hyperthermal therapy and target drug delivery. It is of great significance to summarize these new advances. Herein, the latest reports of the applications of INPs in tumor theranostics are classified to expound the trend of its research and development. The featured functions of it will be discussed in detail to provide a new insight. The key issues needing to be addressed and the development prospective will be put forward. We hope that this review will be helpful to understand the ample potential of INPs in tumor theranostics field.",1,0,1,0,0
23967224,2013,"Fine scale meiotic recombination maps have uncovered a large amount of variation in crossover rate across the genomes of many species, and such variation in mammalian and yeast genomes is concentrated to <5kb regions of highly elevated recombination rates (10-100x the background rate) called ""hotspots."" Drosophila exhibit substantial recombination rate heterogeneity across their genome, but evidence for these highly-localized hotspots is lacking. We assayed recombination across a 40Kb region of Drosophila pseudoobscura chromosome 2, with one 20kb interval assayed every 5Kb and the adjacent 20kb interval bisected into 10kb pieces. We found that recombination events across the 40kb stretch were relatively evenly distributed across each of the 5kb and 10kb intervals, rather than concentrated in a single 5kb region. This, in combination with other recent work, indicates that the recombination landscape of Drosophila may differ from the punctate recombination pattern observed in many mammals and yeast. Additionally, we found no correlation of average pairwise nucleotide diversity and divergence with recombination rate across the 20kb intervals, nor any effect of maternal age in weeks on recombination rate in our sample.

We cloned and sequenced chicken DEC205 cDNA and used this knowledge to produce quantitative PCR assays and monoclonal antibodies to study expression of DEC205 as well as CD83. The gene structure of DEC205 was identical to those of other species. Transcripts of both genes were found at higher levels in lymphoid tissues and the expression of DEC205 in normal birds had a characteristic distribution in the primary lymphoid organs. In spleen, DEC205 was seen on cells ideally located to trap antigen. In thymus it was found on cells thought to participate in the education of T cells, and in the bursa on cells that may be involved in presentation of antigen to B cells and regulation of B cell migration. The expression of DEC205 on cells other than antigen presenting cells (APC) is also described. Isolated splenocytes strongly expressing DEC205 but not the KUL01 antigen have morphology similar to mammalian dendritic cells and the distinct expression of DEC205 within the avian-specific Bursa of Fabricius alludes to a unique function in this organ of B cell diversification.",1,1,2,0,0
26338201,2015,"We develop a procedure to characterize the association of protein structures into homodimers using coevolutionary couplings extracted from Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) in combination with Structure Based Models (SBM). Identification of dimerization contacts using DCA is more challenging than intradomain contacts since direct couplings are mixed with monomeric contacts. Therefore a systematic way to extract dimerization signals has been elusive. We provide evidence that the prediction of homodimeric complexes is possible with high accuracy for all the cases we studied which have rich sequence information. For the most accurate conformations of the structurally diverse dimeric complexes studied the mean and interfacial RMSDs are 1.95Å and 1.44Å, respectively. This methodology is also able to identify distinct dimerization conformations as for the case of the family of response regulators, which dimerize upon activation. The identification of dimeric complexes can provide interesting molecular insights in the construction of large oligomeric complexes and be useful in the study of aggregation related diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.

28945198,2017,"Netrin-1 is a secreted protein that was first identified 20 years ago as an axon guidance molecule that regulates midline crossing in the CNS. It plays critical roles in various tissues throughout development and is implicated in tumorigenesis and inflammation in adulthood. Despite extensive studies, no inherited human disease has been directly associated with mutations in NTN1, the gene coding for netrin-1. Here, we have identified 3 mutations in exon 7 of NTN1 in 2 unrelated families and 1 sporadic case with isolated congenital mirror movements (CMM), a disorder characterized by involuntary movements of one hand that mirror intentional movements of the opposite hand. Given the diverse roles of netrin-1, the absence of manifestations other than CMM in NTN1 mutation carriers was unexpected. Using multimodal approaches, we discovered that the anatomy of the corticospinal tract (CST) is abnormal in patients with NTN1-mutant CMM. When expressed in HEK293 or stable HeLa cells, the 3 mutated netrin-1 proteins were almost exclusively detected in the intracellular compartment, contrary to WT netrin-1, which is detected in both intracellular and extracellular compartments. Since netrin-1 is a diffusible extracellular cue, the pathophysiology likely involves its loss of function and subsequent disruption of axon guidance, resulting in abnormal decussation of the CST.",1,1,2,0,0

11076762,2000,"bHLH transcription factors function in neuronal development in organisms as diverse as worms and vertebrates. In the C. elegans male tail, a neuronal sublineage clonally gives rise to the three cell types (two neurons and a structural cell) of each sensory ray. We show here that the bHLH genes lin-32 and hlh-2 are necessary for the specification of multiple cell fates within this sublineage, and for the proper elaboration of differentiated cell characteristics. Mutations in lin-32, a member of the atonal family, can cause failures at each of these steps, resulting in the formation of rays that lack fully-differentiated neurons, neurons that lack cognate rays, and ray cells defective in the number and morphology of their processes. Mutations in hlh-2, the gene encoding the C. elegans E/daughterless ortholog, enhance the ray defects caused by lin-32 mutations. In vitro, LIN-32 can heterodimerize with HLH-2 and bind to an E-box-containing probe. Mutations in these genes interfere with this activity in a manner consistent with the degree of ray defects observed in vivo. We propose that LIN-32 and HLH-2 function as a heterodimer to activate different sets of targets, at multiple steps in the ray sublineage. During ray development, lin-32 performs roles of proneural, neuronal precursor, and differentiation genes of other systems.",1,1,2,0,0
27936240,2016,"Cost-effective biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass depends on efficient degradation of the plant cell wall. One of the major obstacles for the development of a cost-efficient process is the lack of resistance of currently used fungal enzymes to harsh conditions such as high temperature. Adapted, thermophilic microbial communities provide a huge reservoir of potentially interesting lignocellulose-degrading enzymes for improvement of the cellulose hydrolysis step. In order to identify such enzymes, a leaf and wood chip compost was enriched on a mixture of thermo-chemically pretreated wheat straw, poplar and Miscanthus under thermophile conditions, but in two different set-ups. Unexpectedly, metagenome sequencing revealed that incubation of the lignocellulosic substrate with compost as inoculum in a suspension culture resulted in an impoverishment of putative cellulase- and hemicellulase-encoding genes. However, mimicking composting conditions without liquid phase yielded a high number and diversity of glycoside hydrolase genes and an enrichment of genes encoding cellulose binding domains. These identified genes were most closely related to species from Actinobacteria, which seem to constitute important players of lignocellulose degradation under the applied conditions. The study highlights that subtle changes in an enrichment set-up can have an important impact on composition and functions of the microcosm. Composting-like conditions were found to be the most successful method for enrichment in species with high biomass degrading capacity.",1,0,1,0,0
22482792,2012,"OBJECTIVE:
Grade III arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are diverse because of their variations in size (S), location in eloquent cortex (E), and presence of central venous drainage (V). Because they may have implications for management and outcome, the authors evaluated these variations in the present study.
METHODS:
Between 1984 and 2010, 100 patients with Grade III AVMs were treated. The AVMs were categorized by Spetzler-Martin characteristics as follows: Type 1 = S1E1V1, Type 2 = S2E1V0, Type 3 = S2E0V1, and Type 4 = S3E0V0. The occurrence of a new neurological deficit, functional status (based on modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score) at discharge and follow-up, and radiological obliteration were correlated with demographic and morphological characteristics.
RESULTS:
One hundred patients (49 female and 51 male; age range 5-68 years, mean 35.8 years) were evaluated. The size of AVMs was less than 3 cm in 28 patients, 3-6 cm in 71, and greater than 6 cm in 1; 86 AVMs were located in eloquent cortex and 38 had central drainage. The AVMs were Type 1 in 28 cases, Type 2 in 60, Type 3 in 11, and Type 4 in 1. The authors performed embolization in 77 patients (175 procedures), surgery in 64 patients (74 surgeries), and radiosurgery in 49 patients (44 primary and 5 postoperative). The mortality rate following the management of these AVMs was 1%. Fourteen patients (14%) had new neurological deficits, with 5 (5%) being disabling (mRS score > 2) and 9 (9%) being nondisabling (mRS score ≤ 2) events. Patients with Type 1 AVMs (small size) had the best outcome, with 1 (3.6%) in 28 having a new neurological deficit, compared with 72 patients with larger AVMs, of whom 13 (18.1%) had a new neurological deficit (p < 0.002). Older age (> 40 years), malformation size > 3 cm, and nonhemorrhagic presentation predicted the occurrence of new deficits (p < 0.002). Sex, eloquent cortex, and venous drainage did not confer any benefit. In 89 cases follow-up was adequate for data to be included in the obliteration analysis. The AVM was obliterated in 78 patients (87.6%), 69 of them (88.5%) demonstrated on angiography and 9 on MRI /MR angiography. There was no difference between obliteration rates between different types of AVMs, size, eloquence, and drainage. Age, sex, and clinical presentation also did not predict obliteration.
CONCLUSIONS:
Multimodality management of Grade III AVMs results in a high rate of obliteration, which was not influenced by size, venous drainage, or eloquent location. However, the development of new neurological deficits did correlate with size, whereas eloquence and venous drainage did not affect the neurological complication rate. The authors propose subclassifying the Grade III AVMs according to their size (< 3 and ≥ 3 cm) to account for treatment risk.

9920077,1999,"Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are insulin resistant, have insulin secretory defects, and are at high risk for glucose intolerance. We performed this study to determine the prevalence of glucose intolerance and parameters associated with risk for this in PCOS women. Two-hundred and fifty-four PCOS women, aged 14-44 yr, were prospectively evaluated at 2 centers, 1 urban and ethnically diverse (n = 110) and 1 rural and ethnically homogeneous (n = 144). The rural PCOS women were compared to 80 control women of similar weight, ethnicity, and age. A 75-g oral glucose challenge was administered after a 3-day 300-g carbohydrate diet and an overnight fast with 0 and 2 h blood samples for glucose levels. Diabetes was categorized according to WHO criteria. The prevalence of glucose intolerance was 31.1% impaired glucose intolerance (IGT) and 7.5% diabetes. In nonobese PCOS women (body mass index, <27 kg/m2), 10.3% IGT and 1.5% diabetes were found. The prevalence of glucose intolerance was significantly higher in PCOS vs. control women (chi2 = 7.0; P = 0.01; odds ratio = 2.76; 95% confidence interval = 1.23-6.57). Variables most associated with postchallenge glucose levels were fasting glucose levels (P < 0.0001), PCOS status (P = 0.002), waist/hip ratio (P = 0.01), and body mass index (P = 0.021).

We conclude that 1) PCOS women are at significantly increased risk for IGT and type 2 diabetes mellitus at all weights and at a young age; 2) these prevalence rates are similar in 2 different populations of PCOS women, suggesting that PCOS may be a more important risk factor than ethnicity or race for glucose intolerance in young women; and 3) the American Diabetes Association diabetes diagnostic criteria failed to detect a significant number of PCOS women with diabetes by postchallenge glucose values.",1,1,21,5,7
25083770,2014,"Transformations of natural landscapes and their biodiversity have become increasingly dramatic and intense, creating a demand for rapid and inexpensive methods to assess and monitor ecosystems, especially the most vulnerable ones, such as aquatic systems. The speed with which surveys can collect, identify, and describe ecological patterns is much slower than that of the loss of biodiversity. Thus, there is a tendency for higher-level taxonomic identification to be used, a practice that is justified by factors such as the cost-benefit ratio, and the lack of taxonomists and reliable information on species distributions and diversity. However, most of these studies do not evaluate the degree of representativeness obtained by different taxonomic resolutions. Given this demand, the present study aims to investigate the congruence between species-level and genus-level data for the infraorder Nepomorpha, based on taxonomic and numerical resolutions. We collected specimens of aquatic Nepomorpha from five streams of first to fourth order of magnitude in the Pindaíba River Basin in the Cerrado of the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, totaling 20 sites. A principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) applied to the data indicated that species-level and genus-level abundances were relatively similar (>80% similarity), although this similarity was reduced when compared with the presence/absence of genera (R = 0.77). The presence/absence ordinations of species and genera were similar to those recorded for their abundances (R = 0.95 and R = 0.74, respectively). The results indicate that analyses at the genus level may be used instead of species, given a loss of information of 11 to 19%, although congruence is higher when using abundance data instead of presence/absence. This analysis confirms that the use of the genus level data is a safe shortcut for environmental monitoring studies, although this approach must be treated with caution when the objectives include conservation actions, and faunal complementarity and/or inventories.

29895264,2018,"BACKGROUND:
Alcohol marketing on social networking sites (SNS) is associated with alcohol use among young people. Alcohol companies adapt their online marketing content to specific national contexts and responses to such content differ by national settings. However, there exists very little academic work comparing the association between alcohol marketing on SNS and alcohol use among young people in different national settings and across different SNS. Therefore, we aimed to extend the limited existing work by investigating and comparing the association between self-reported exposure to alcohol marketing on three leading SNS (Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter) and alcohol use among young people in diverse national contexts (India and Australia).
METHODS:
Cross-sectional, self-report data were obtained from a convenience sample of 631 respondents (330 in India; 301 in Australia) aged 13-25 years via online surveys. Respondents answered questions on their drinking behaviors and involvement with alcohol marketing on SNS.
RESULTS:
Many respondents from both countries reported interacting with alcohol content online, predominantly on Facebook, followed by YouTube and then Twitter. The interaction was primarily in the forms of posting/liking/sharing/commenting on items posted on alcohol companies' social media accounts, viewing the event page/attending the event advertised by an alcohol company via social media, and/or accessing an alcohol website. Multivariate analyses demonstrated significant associations between respondents' interaction with alcohol content and drinking levels, with effects differing by SNS, demographic group, and country. For example, having friends who shared alcohol-related content was an important predictor of usual alcohol consumption for Indian respondents (p < .001), whereas posting alcohol-related information themselves was a stronger predictor among Australians (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS:
The results suggest that interaction with alcohol-related content on SNS is associated with young people's alcohol use behaviors and that these behaviors vary by national settings. This study extends previous work by demonstrating this connection across varying social media platforms and national contexts. The results highlight the need to formulate and implement strategies to effectively regulate the SNS alcohol marketing, especially among younger SNS users.

17057235,2006,"The many reports of trans interactions between homologous as well as nonhomologous loci in a wide variety of organisms argue that such interactions play an important role in gene regulation. The yellow locus of Drosophila is especially useful for investigating the mechanisms of trans interactions due to its ability to support transvection and the relative ease with which it can be altered by targeted gene replacement. In this study, we exploit these aspects of yellow to further our understanding of cis as well as trans forms of enhancer-promoter communication. Through the analysis of yellow alleles whose promoters have been replaced with wild-type or altered promoters from other genes, we show that mutation of single core promoter elements of two of the three heterologous promoters tested can influence whether yellow enhancers act in cis or in trans. This finding parallels observations of the yellow promoter, suggesting that the manner in which trans interactions are controlled by core promoter elements describes a general mechanism. We further demonstrate that heterologous promoters themselves can be activated in trans as well as participate in pairing-mediated insulator bypass. These results highlight the potential of diverse promoters to partake in many forms of trans interactions.",1,0,1,0,0
31391007,2019,"BACKGROUND:
In recent years, research on cancer predisposition germline variants has emerged as a prominent field. The identity of somatic mutations is based on a reliable mapping of the patient germline variants. In addition, the statistics of germline variants frequencies in healthy individuals and cancer patients is the basis for seeking candidates for cancer predisposition genes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is one of the main sources of such data, providing a diverse collection of molecular data including deep sequencing for more than 30 types of cancer from > 10,000 patients.
METHODS:
Our hypothesis in this study is that whole exome sequences from blood samples of cancer patients are not expected to show systematic differences among cancer types. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed common and rare germline variants across six cancer types, covering 2241 samples from TCGA. In our analysis we accounted for inherent variables in the data including the different variant calling protocols, sequencing platforms, and ethnicity.
RESULTS:
We report on substantial batch effects in germline variants associated with cancer types. We attribute the effect to the specific sequencing centers that produced the data. Specifically, we measured 30% variability in the number of reported germline variants per sample across sequencing centers. The batch effect is further expressed in nucleotide composition and variant frequencies. Importantly, the batch effect causes substantial differences in germline variant distribution patterns across numerous genes, including prominent cancer predisposition genes such as BRCA1, RET, MAX, and KRAS. For most of known cancer predisposition genes, we found a distinct batch-dependent difference in germline variants.
CONCLUSIONS:
TCGA germline data is exposed to strong batch effects with substantial variabilities among TCGA sequencing centers. We claim that those batch effects are consequential for numerous TCGA pan-cancer studies. In particular, these effects may compromise the reliability and the potency to detect new cancer predisposition genes. Furthermore, interpretation of pan-cancer analyses should be revisited in view of the source of the genomic data after accounting for the reported batch effects.

Here we show, by quantifying the growth of 541 tropical tree species across a steep natural phosphorus gradient in Panama, that phosphorus limitation is widespread at the level of individual species and strengthens markedly below a threshold of two parts per million exchangeable soil phosphate. However, this pervasive species-specific phosphorus limitation does not translate into a community-wide response, because some species grow rapidly on infertile soils despite extremely low phosphorus availability.

The well-known role of background K(+) currents is to stabilize the negative resting membrane potential and counterbalance depolarization. However, it has become apparent in the past decade (during the detailed examination of the cloned and corresponding native K(2P) channel types) that this primary hyperpolarizing action is not performed passively. The K(2P) channels are regulated by a wide variety of voltage-independent factors. Basic physicochemical parameters (e.g., pH, temperature, membrane stretch) and also several intracellular signaling pathways substantially and specifically modulate the different members of the six K(2P) channel subfamilies (TWIK, TREK, TASK, TALK, THIK, and TRESK). The deep implication in diverse physiological processes, the circumscribed expression pattern of the different channels, and the interesting pharmacological profile brought the K(2P) channel family into the spotlight. In this review, we focus on the physiological roles of K(2P) channels in the most extensively investigated cell types, with special emphasis on the molecular mechanisms of channel regulation.",1,0,1,0,0

The integration of digital technology into everyday lives of young people has become widespread. It is not known whether and how technology influences barriers and facilitators to healthcare, and whether and how young people navigate between face-to-face and virtual healthcare. To provide new knowledge essential to policy and practice, we designed a study that would explore health system access and navigation in the digital age. The study objectives are to: (1) describe experiences of young people accessing and navigating the health system in New South Wales (NSW), Australia; (2) identify barriers and facilitators to healthcare for young people and how these vary between groups; (3) describe health system inefficiencies, particularly for young people who are marginalised; (4) provide policy-relevant knowledge translation of the research data.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS:
This mixed methods study has four parts, including: (1) a cross-sectional survey of young people (12-24 years) residing in NSW, Australia; (2) a longitudinal, qualitative study of a subsample of marginalised young people (defined as young people who: identify as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander; are experiencing homelessness; identify as sexuality and/or gender diverse; are of refugee or vulnerable migrant background; and/or live in rural or remote NSW); (3) interviews with professionals; (4) a knowledge translation forum.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:
Ethics approvals were sought and granted. Data collection commenced in March 2016 and will continue until June 2017. This study will gather practice and policy-relevant intelligence about contemporary experiences of young people and health services, with a unique focus on five different groups of marginalised young people, documenting their experiences over time.

Tuberculosis (TB), particularly multi- and or extensive drug resistant TB, is still a global medical emergency. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a current alternative to the WHO-approved probe-based methods for TB diagnosis and detection of drug resistance, genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). This study compared WGS and clinical data in participants with TB.
RESULTS:
This cohort study performed WGS on 87 from MTBC DNA isolates, 57 (66%) and 30 (34%) patients with drug resistant and susceptible TB, respectively. Drug resistance was determined by Xpert® MTB/RIF assay and phenotypic culture-based drug-susceptibility-testing (DST). WGS and bioinformatics data that predict phenotypic resistance to anti-TB drugs were compared with participant's clinical outcomes. They were 47 female participants (54%) and the median age was 35 years (IQR): 29-44). Twenty (23%) and 26 (30%) of participants had TB/HIV co-infection BMI < 18 kg/m
CONCLUSIONS:
This study offers comparison of mutations detected by Xpert and WGS with phenotypic DST of M. tuberculosis isolates in Tanzania. The high concordance between the different methods and further insights provided by WGS such as PZA-DST, which is not routinely performed in most resource-limited-settings, provides an avenue for inclusion of WGS into diagnostic matrix of TB including drug-resistant TB.

22709444,2012,"As of the 2006 census, nearly one fifth of Canada's population was foreign-born. With such a sizeable and fast-growing immigrant population, research in immigrant health in Canada is increasingly important, including research on the smoking behaviours of Canada's immigrants. Research has shown that immigrants are significantly less likely to smoke than non-immigrants, yet differences by immigrant origins have yet to be fully explored. This paper explores smoking prevalence and cessation amongst immigrants in Canada disaggregated by country of birth. Additionally, it examines the impact of neighbourhood level effects on smoking cessation to determine if residential location has an impact on the likelihood of quitting. Results reveal important heterogeneities previously unseen in studies employing aggregate data. While immigrants in general were less likely to smoke than non-immigrants, and are also more likely to quit than non-immigrants, considerable variation exists between immigrant groups defined by origin region or country. Asian immigrants were the least likely to smoke but exhibited the greatest variation between countries of origin. Vietnamese men were found to be the most likely immigrant group to smoke and among the least likely to quit. While neighbourhood disadvantage was negatively associated with quitting smoking, it is not as important as individual socioeconomic characteristics in explaining variations in smoking cessation. The research illustrates the need for disaggregated data to account for the diversity of Canada's immigrant population.",1,1,18,1,4
29057906,2017,"Embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells are pluripotent stem cells extensively used for studies of cell differentiation. Although retinoic acid (RA) is a powerful inducer of neurogenesis in EC cells, it is not clear what specific neuronal subtypes are generated and whether different RAR isotypes may contribute to such neuronal diversification. Here we show that RA treatment during EC embryoid body formation is a highly robust protocol for generation of striatal-like GABAergic neurons which display molecular characteristics of striatopallidal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), including expression of functional dopamine D2 receptor. By using RARα, β and γ selective agonists we show that RARγ is the functionally dominant RAR in mediating RA control of early molecular determinants of MSNs leading to formation of striatopallidal-like neurons. In contrast, activation of RARα is less efficient in generation of this class of neurons, but is essential for differentiation of functional dopaminergic neurons, which may correspond to a subpopulation of inhibitory dopaminergic neurons expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase in vivo.",1,0,1,0,0
8000998,1995,"BACKGROUND:
Malignant neoplasms of the structural tissues, consisting mostly of soft tissue sarcomas, are morphologically diverse and rarely treated for epidemiologic purposes as individual entities. Our understanding to date of the pattern of occurrence of sarcomas is based largely on reports of limited individual clinic experience or case-control studies, each driven by a single hypothesis, and there have been virtually no descriptions according to specific morphologic type.
METHODS:
The accumulated coverage of the SEER populations offers an opportunity to correct this deficit. Each of the diagnoses has been reported and coded using a single set of rules and described in relation to the population at risk in terms of age, sex, race, calendar period, anatomic location, and outcome. In addition, each morphologic type has been compared with each of the others with respect to the pattern of occurrence and survival.
RESULTS:
For most of the individual morphologic entities, the pattern of occurrence is specific and unlike other patterns. Differences according to anatomic site, age, sex, race, and period-specific survival were found. Partly because of changes in diagnostic criteria over the years, differences in secular trend, other than that for Kaposi's sarcoma, could not be verified. Although some types of sarcoma may have important genetic determinants, there is evidence of environmental causation in others; for some varieties both genetic and environmental factors may operate. There is no evidence of improvements in survival.
CONCLUSIONS:
The most likely basis for the observed patterns are morphology-specific differences in etiology and growth phase. Each of the entities should be considered etiologically distinct and should be studied individually whenever possible.

Attention will be given to various practical aspects of somatic DN of different types with their specific clinical presentation, diagnostic approaches and treatment options, including the usually rarely discussed gender differences. DN remains a problem in diabetology, compared to other micro- and macrovascular complications. The disease is rarely investigated, although simple testing devices for somatic nerve impairment exist, and remains difficult to treat because ofthe complex pathogenetic mechanisms. The main prevention/progression delaying measure for the progression of DN is the tight glycaemic control. Painful DN is common and need appropriate symptomatic relieving drugs.

25183755,2014,"OBJECTIVE:
There is a dearth of information on the long-term maternal effects of breastfeeding. The objective of this study was to examine adherence to breastfeeding recommendations of exclusive breastfeeding for ≥4 months and continuation of breastfeeding for ≥1 year and maternal weight retention 6 years after delivery.
METHODS:
Using data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II), we categorized women by the degree to which they met breastfeeding recommendations. Mothers' self-reported weight 6 years after delivery (IFPS Year 6 Follow-Up) was compared with self-reported prepregnancy weight from IFPS II. Using linear regression models, adjusting for covariates, we examined associations between breastfeeding recommendation adherence and weight retention.
RESULTS:
Of the 726 women in our study, 17.9% never breastfed. Among those who initiated breastfeeding, 29.0% breastfed exclusively for ≥4 months, and 20.3% breastfed exclusively for ≥4 months and continued breastfeeding for ≥12 months. Prepregnancy BMI modified the association between breastfeeding recommendation adherence and weight retention. Adjusting for covariates, we found no association between breastfeeding recommendations adherence and weight retention among normal and overweight mothers. Among obese mothers, there was a significant linear trend (P = .03), suggesting that those who fully adhered to breastfeeding recommendations retained less weight (-8.0 kg) than obese women who never breastfed.
CONCLUSIONS:
This study suggests that improving adherence to breastfeeding recommendations may help reduce long-term maternal weight retention among obese mothers. Larger studies, with diverse populations and similar longitudinal designs, are needed to explore this relationship.

30112409,2018,"Surrogacy is an assisted reproduction-based approach in which the intended parents assign the gestation and birth to another woman called the surrogate mother. The drivers of surrogacy refer largely to infertility, medical conditions, same-sex couples' parenting, and cases of diversity regarding sexual identity and orientation. Surrogacy consists of a valid option for a variety of conditions or circumstances ranging from medical to social reasons. However, surrogacy may be associated with risks during the preimplantation, prenatal, and neonatal period. It became obvious during the exhaustive literature research that data on surrogacy and its association with factors specific to the IVF practice and the options available were not fully represented. Could it be that surrogacy management adds another level of complexity to the process from the ovarian stimulation, the subsequent IVF cycle, and the techniques employed within the IVF and the Genetic Laboratory to the fetal, perinatal, and neonatal period? This work emphasizes the risks associated with surrogacy with respect to the preimplantation embryo, the fetus, and the infant. Moreover, it further calls for larger studies reporting on surrogacy and comparing the surrogate management to that of the routine IVF patient in order to avoid suboptimal management of a surrogate cycle.

Inter-ethnic admixture is either common or increasing quickly in many, if not most, populations, and so extrapolation on a global scale of pharmacogenomic data from well-defined ethnic groups is plagued with uncertainty. To impact positively on global health, pharmacogenomics must broaden its scope of investigation with respect to both target and population diversity, and avoid the risk of contributing to the creation of a genomics divide between regions and nations.

29548855,2018,"BACKGROUND:
In developed countries, smoking is associated with increased risk of diabetes. Little is known about the association in China, where cigarette consumption has increased (first in urban, then in rural areas) relatively recently. Moreover, uncertainty remains about the effect of smoking cessation on diabetes in China and elsewhere. We aimed to assess the associations of smoking and smoking cessation with risk of incident diabetes among Chinese adults.
METHODS:
The prospective China Kadoorie Biobank enrolled 512 891 adults (59% women) aged 30-79 years during 2004-08 from ten diverse areas (five urban and five rural) across China. Participants were interviewed at study assessment clinics, underwent physical measurements, and had a non-fasting blood sample taken. Participants were separated into four categories according to smoking history: never-smokers, ever-regular smokers, ex-smokers, and occasional smokers. Incident diabetes cases were identified through linkage with diabetes surveillance systems, the national health insurance system, and death registries. All analyses were done separately in men and women and Cox regression was used to yield adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) for diabetes associated with smoking.
FINDINGS:
68% (n=134 975) of men ever smoked regularly compared with 3% (n=7811) of women. During 9 years' follow-up, 13 652 new-onset diabetes cases were recorded among 482 589 participants without previous diabetes. Among urban men, smokers had an adjusted HR of 1·18 (95% CI 1·12-1·25) for diabetes. HRs increased with younger age at first smoking regularly (1·12, 1·20, and 1·27 at ≥25 years, 20-24 years, and <20 years, respectively; p for trend=0·00073) and with greater amount smoked (1·11, 1·15, 1·42, and 1·63 for <20, 20-29, 30-39 and ≥40 cigarettes per day; p for trend<0·0001). Among rural men, similar, albeit more modest, associations were seen. Overall, HRs were more extreme at higher levels of adiposity. Among men who stopped by choice, there was no excess risk within 5 years of cessation, contrasting with those who stopped because of illness (0·92 [0·75-1·12] vs 1·42 [1·23-1·63]). Among the few women who ever smoked regularly, the excess risk of diabetes was significant (1·33 [1·20-1·47]).
INTERPRETATION:
Among Chinese adults, smoking was associated with increased risk of diabetes, with no significant excess risk following voluntary smoking cessation.

Here, we use ~36 million singleton variants from 3560 whole-genome sequences to infer fine-scale patterns of mutation rate heterogeneity. Mutability is jointly affected by adjacent nucleotide context and diverse genomic features of the surrounding region, including histone modifications, replication timing, and recombination rate, sometimes suggesting specific mutagenic mechanisms. Remarkably, GC content, DNase hypersensitivity, CpG islands, and H3K36 trimethylation are associated with both increased and decreased mutation rates depending on nucleotide context. We validate these estimated effects in an independent dataset of ~46,000 de novo mutations, and confirm our estimates are more accurate than previously published results based on ancestrally older variants without considering genomic features. Our results thus provide the most refined portrait to date of the factors contributing to genome-wide variability of the human germline mutation rate.",1,1,2,0,0

We demonstrate that intracellular clonal expansion of somatic point mutations is a common event in normal human tissues. This finding implies efficient homogenization of mitochondrial genomes within individual cells. Significant qualitative differences observed between the spectra of clonally expanded mutations in proliferating epithelial cells and postmitotic cardiomyocytes suggest, however, that either the processes generating these mutations or mechanisms driving them to homoplasmy are likely to be fundamentally different between the two tissues. Furthermore, the ability of somatic mtDNA mutations to expand (required for their phenotypic expression), as well as their apparently high incidence, reinforces the possibility that these mutations may be involved actively in various physiological processes such as aging and degenerative disease. The abundance of clonally expanded point mutations in individual cells of normal tissues also suggests that the recently discovered accumulation of mtDNA mutations in tumors may be explained by processes that are similar or identical to those operating in the normal tissue.",1,1,2,0,0

These models were originally developed for Panamanian trees and successfully reproduce observed distributions of abundance. Neutral models also make macroevolutionary predictions that have rarely been evaluated or tested. Here we show that neutral models predict a humped or flat relationship between species age and population size. In contrast, ages and abundances of tree species in the Panamanian Canal watershed are found to be positively correlated, which falsifies the models. Speciation rates vary among phylogenetic lineages and are partially heritable from mother to daughter species. Variable speciation rates in an otherwise neutral model lead to a demographic advantage for species with low speciation rate. This demographic advantage results in a positive correlation between species age and abundance, as found in the Panamanian tropical forest community. ",1,1,3,0,3
22046426,2011,"Monoclonal antibodies directed against hepatitis C virus (HCV) E2 protein can neutralize cell-cultured HCV and pseudoparticles expressing envelopes derived from multiple HCV subtypes. For example, based on antibody blocking experiments and alanine scanning mutagenesis, it was proposed that the AR3B monoclonal antibody recognized a discontinuous conformational epitope comprised of amino acid residues 396-424, 436-447, and 523-540 of HCV E2 envelope protein. Intriguingly, one of these segments (436-447) overlapped with hypervariable region 3 (HVR3), a domain that exhibited significant intrahost and interhost genetic diversity. To reconcile these observations, amino-acid sequence variability was examined and homology-based structural modelling of E2 based on tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) E protein was performed based on 413 HCV sequences derived from 18 subjects with chronic hepatitis C. Here we report that despite a high degree of amino-acid sequence variability, the three-dimensional structure of E2 is remarkably conserved, suggesting broad recognition of structural determinants rather than specific residues. Regions 396-424 and 523-540 were largely exposed and in close spatial proximity at the surface of E2. In contrast, region 436-447, which overlaps with HVR3, was >35 Å away, and estimates of buried surface were inconsistent with HVR3 being part of the AR3B binding interface.

Their fatty acids vary greatly between regions, suggesting dietary differences at a spatial scale. The fatty acid C22:6ω3 was more abundant in sea lions from the northern region, likely associated with consumption of anchovy, cephalopods, and crustaceans, which are rich in that fatty acid, and have been reported as their main prey items. Sea lions from the southern region were richer in C22:1 and C20:1, characteristic of teleost fish, suggesting a piscivorous diet. Males displayed a more diverse fatty acid composition than females, suggesting a wider trophic niche. Few individual sea lions within the southern region had unusually high levels of C18:2ω6, commonly found in terrestrial environments.

20140218,2010,"Drosophila oogenesis is especially well suited for studying stem cell biology, cellular differentiation, and morphogenesis. The small modifier protein ubiquitin regulates many cellular pathways. Ubiquitin is conjugated to target proteins by a diverse class of enzymes called ubiquitin E3 ligases. Here we characterize the requirement of Cul-5, a key component of a subgroup of Cullin-RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligases, in Drosophila oogenesis. We find that reduced cul-5 activity causes the formation of aberrant follicles that are characterized by excess germ cells. We show that germ line cells overproliferate in cul-5 mutant females, causing the formation of abnormally large germ line cysts. Also, the follicular epithelium that normally encapsulates single germ line cysts develops aberrantly in cul-5 mutant, leading to defects in cyst formation. We additionally found that Cul-5 is required for germ cell maintenance, as germ cells are depleted in a substantial fraction of cul-5 mutant ovaries. All of these cul-5 phenotypes are strongly enhanced by reduced activity of gustavus (gus), which encodes a substrate receptor of Cul-5-based ubiquitin E3 ligases.

7892194,1995,"The prehistoric settlement of the Pacific Ocean has intrigued scholars and stimulated anthropological debate for the past two centuries. Colonized over a few millennia during the mid to late Holocene, the islands of the Pacific--displaying a wide diversity of geological and biotic variability--provided the stage for endless ""natural experiments"" in human adaptation. Crucial to understanding the evolution and transformation of island societies is documenting the relative degree of interisland contacts after island colonization. In the western Pacific, ideal materials for archaeologically documenting interisland contact--obsidian, pottery, and shell ornaments--are absent or of limited geographic distribution in Polynesia. Consequently, archaeologists have relied increasingly on fine-grained basalt artifacts as a means for documenting colonization routes and subsequent interisland contacts. Routinely used x-ray fluorescence characterization of oceanic island basalt has some problems for discriminating source rocks and artifacts in provenance studies. The variation in trace and major element abundances is largely controlled by near-surface magma-chamber processes and is broadly similar between most oceanic islands. We demonstrate that Pb isotope analysis accurately discriminates rock source and is an excellent technique for charting the scale, frequency, and temporal span of imported fine-grained basalt artifacts found throughout Polynesia.

30987988,2019,"OBJECTIVE:
The role of primary care providers (PCP) in the cancer care continuum is expanding. In the post-treatment phase, this role is increasingly recognised by policy makers and healthcare professionals. During treatment, however, the role of PCP remains largely undefined. This systematic review aims to map the content and effect of interventions aiming to actively involve the general practitioner (GP) during cancer treatment with a curative intent.
STUDY DESIGN:
Systematic review.
PARTICIPANTS:
Patients with cancer treated with curative intent.
DATA SOURCES:
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCT), controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series focusing on interventions designed to involve the GP during curative cancer treatment were systematically identified from PubMed and EMBASE and were subsequently reviewed. Risk of bias was scored according to the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group risk of bias criteria.
RESULTS:
Five RCTs and one CCT were included. Interventions and effects were heterogeneous across studies. Four studies implemented interventions focussing on information transfer to the GP and two RCTs implemented patient-tailored GP interventions. The studies have a low-medium risk of bias. Three studies show a low uptake of the intervention. A positive effect on patient satisfaction with care was found in three studies. Subgroup analysis suggests a reduction of healthcare use in elderly patients and reduction of clinical anxiety in those with higher mental distress. No effects are reported on patients' quality of life (QoL).
CONCLUSION:
Interventions designed to actively involve the GP during curative cancer treatment are scarce and diverse. Even though uptake of interventions is low, results suggest a positive effect of GP involvement on patient satisfaction with care, but not on QoL. Additional effects for vulnerable subgroups were found. More robust evidence for tailored interventions is needed to enable the efficient and effective involvement of the GP during curative cancer treatment.

The mechanisms by which these trafficking pathways are regulated are not fully characterized. Here we identify the transmembrane protein OSTA-1 as a new regulator of the trafficking pathways that shape the morphology and protein composition of sensory cilia in C. elegans. osta-1 encodes an organic solute transporter alpha-like protein, mammalian homologs of which have been implicated in membrane trafficking and solute transport, although a role in regulating cilia structure has not previously been demonstrated. We show that mutations in osta-1 result in altered ciliary membrane volume, branch length and complexity, as well as defects in localization of a subset of ciliary transmembrane proteins in different sensory cilia types. OSTA-1 is associated with transport vesicles, localizes to a ciliary compartment shown to house trafficking proteins, and regulates both retrograde and anterograde flux of the endosome-associated RAB-5 small GTPase. Genetic epistasis experiments with sensory signaling, exocytic and endocytic proteins further implicate OSTA-1 as a crucial regulator of ciliary architecture via regulation of cilia-destined trafficking.

Using over 4,500 archival human serum specimens collected from 19 Pacific populations between 1959 and 1979, the period including and just prior to the appearance of chloroquine treatment failure in the Pacific, we PCR-amplified and sequenced a portion of the pfcrt exon 2 from 771 P. falciparum-infected individuals to explore the spatial and temporal variation in falciparum malaria prevalence and the evolution of chloroquine resistance. In the Pacific, the prevalence of P. falciparum varied considerably across ecological zones. On the island of New Guinea, the decreases in prevalence of P. falciparum in coastal, high-transmission areas over time were contrasted by the increase in prevalence during the same period in the highlands, where transmission was intermittent. We found 78 unique pfcrt haplotypes consisting of 34 amino acid substitutions and 28 synonymous mutations. More importantly, two pfcrt mutations (N75D and K76T) implicated in chloroquine resistance were present in parasites from New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) eight years before the first report of treatment failure. Our results also revealed unexpectedly high levels of genetic diversity in pfcrt exon 2 prior to the historical chloroquine resistance selective sweep, particularly in areas where disease burden was relatively low. In the Pacific, parasite genetic isolation, as well as host acquired immune status and genetic resistance to malaria, were important contributors to the evolution of chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum.",1,0,1,0,2

30350853,2018,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a family of innate effector cells including NK cells, lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, and distinct ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 subsets that produce IFN-γ, IL-5/IL-13, and IL-17A/IL-22, respectively. ILCs accumulate at mucosal sites and can promote the first-line defense against infection. ILCs are also implicated in tissue repair and can either pre-empt, or alternatively, exacerbate inflammation. Studies in mice have identified ILC precursors in fetal liver and adult BM that have diverse lineage potential. As such, these sites have been considered as the 'factories' to generate mature ILC. Here, we summarize knowledge concerning murine and human ILC development and discuss the recent identification of circulating multipotent and unipotent ILC precursors. We propose an alternative model of ""ILC-poiesis"", whereby blood ILC precursors migrate into tissues to complete their differentiation into mature ILC subsets under the influence of local environmental factors. Within this framework, ILC-poiesis guarantees appropriate ILC generation at the right place and the right time. We further discusss the potential applications of circulating ILC precursors for cell therapy of human disease.",1,1,2,0,0
33091960,2020,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common malignancy representing 90% of all forms of oral cancer worldwide. Although great efforts have been made in the past decades, the 5-year survival rate of OSCC patients is no more than 60% due to tumor metastasis and subsequent recurrence. The metastasis from the primary site is due to a complex process known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During the EMT, epithelial cells gradually acquire the structural and functional characteristics of mesenchymal cells, leading to the upregulation of cell migration and the promotion of tumor cell dissemination. Therefore, EMT attracted broad attention due to its close relationship with cancer invasion and metastasis. Therefore, in the present review, an extensive description of the current research on OSCC and the role of EMT in this cancer type is provided, including diverse EMT markers, regulatory networks and crucial EMT-inducing transcription factors in OSCC. Moreover, a brief summary was made regarding the current application of EMT-correlated indexes in the prognostic analysis of OSCC patients, and the potential therapeutic approaches against OSCC and difficulties in the development of an effective anti-EMT treatment are discussed. Our aim is to provide novel insights to develop new strategies to combat OSCC by targeting EMT.",1,0,1,0,0

27861554,2016,"OBJECTIVE:
To characterize the vaginal microbiota of women following preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and determine if microbiome composition predicts latency duration and perinatal outcomes.
METHODS:
A prospective cohort study.
METHODS:
Canada.
METHODS:
Women with PPROM between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks gestational age (GA).
METHODS:
Microbiome profiles, based on pyrosequencing of the cpn60 universal target, were generated from vaginal samples at time of presentation with PPROM, weekly thereafter, and at delivery.
METHODS:
Vaginal microbiome composition, latency duration, gestational age at delivery, perinatal outcomes.
RESULTS:
Microbiome profiles were generated from 70 samples from 36 women. Mean GA at PPROM was 28.8 wk (mean latency 2.7 wk). Microbiome profiles were highly diverse but sequences representing Megasphaera type 1 and Prevotella spp. were detected in all vaginal samples. Only 13/70 samples were dominated by Lactobacillus spp. Microbiome profiles at the time of membrane rupture did not cluster by gestational age at PPROM, latency duration, presence of chorioamnionitis or by infant outcomes. Mycoplasma and/or Ureaplasma were detected by PCR in 81% (29/36) of women, and these women had significantly lower GA at delivery and correspondingly lower birth weight infants than Mycoplasma and/or Ureaplasma negative women.
CONCLUSIONS:
Women with PPROM had mixed, abnormal vaginal microbiota but the microbiome profile at PPROM did not correlate with latency duration. Prevotella spp. and Megasphaera type I were ubiquitous. The presence of Mollicutes in the vaginal microbiome was associated with lower GA at delivery. The microbiome was remarkably unstable during the latency period.

31633751,2019,"BACKGROUND:
Many transgender individuals choose to undergo gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT) and/or sex reassignment surgery (SRS) to alleviate the distress that is associated with gender dysphoria. Although these treatment options often succeed in alleviating such symptoms, they can also negatively impact future reproductive potential.
OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE:
The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the available psychosocial and medical literature on fertility preservation (FP) for transgender adolescents and young adults (TAYAs), to identify gaps in the current research and provide suggestions for future research directions.
SEARCH METHODS:
A systematic review of English peer-reviewed papers published from 2001 onwards, using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines, was conducted. Four journal databases (Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed Medline, Ovid Embase and Ovid PsychINFO) were used to identify all relevant studies exploring psychosocial or medical aspects of FP in TAYAs. The search strategy used a combination of subject headings and generic terms related to the study topic and population. Bibliographies of the selected articles were also hand searched and cross-checked to ensure comprehensive coverage. All selected papers were independently reviewed by the co-authors. Characteristics of the studies, objectives and key findings were extracted, and a systematic review was conducted.
OUTCOMES:
Included in the study were 19 psychosocial-based research papers and 21 medical-based research papers that explore fertility-related aspects specific for this population. Key psychosocial themes included the desire to have children for TAYAs; FP discussions, counselling and referrals provided by healthcare providers (HCPs); FP utilization; the attitudes, knowledge and beliefs of TAYAs, HCPs and the parents/guardians of TAYAs; and barriers to accessing FP. Key medical themes included fertility-related effects of GAHT, FP options and outcomes. From a synthesis of the literature, we conclude that there are many barriers preventing TAYAs from pursuing FP, including a lack of awareness of FP options, high costs, invasiveness of the available procedures and the potential psychological impact of the FP process. The available medical data on the reproductive effects of GAHT are diverse, and while detrimental effects are anticipated, the extent to which these effects are reversible is unknown.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS:
FP counselling should begin as early as possible as a standard of care before GAHT to allow time for informed decisions. The current lack of high-quality medical data specific to FP counselling practice for this population means there is a reliance on expert opinion and extrapolation from studies in the cisgender population. Future research should include large-scale cohort studies (preferably multi-centered), longitudinal studies of TAYAs across the FP process, qualitative studies of the parents/guardians of TAYAs and studies evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies to improve the attitudes, knowledge and beliefs of HCPs.

Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa L ssp. indica cultivar 3037) semi-dwarf mutant sd37, in which the gene CYP96B4 (Cytochrome P450 96B subfamily) was identified and confirmed as the target by map-based cloning and a complementation test. A point mutation in the SRS2 domain of CYP96B4 resulted in a threonine to lysine substitution in the sd37 mutant. Examination of the subcellular localization of the protein revealed that SD37 was ER-localized protein. And SD37 was predominantly expressed in the shoot apical meristem and developing leaf and root maturation zone but not in the root apical meristem. The sd37 leaves, panicles, and seeds were smaller than those of the wild type. Histological analysis further revealed that a decrease in cell number in the mutant, specifically in the shoots, was the main cause of the dwarf phenotype. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of several cell division-related genes was disturbed in the sd37 mutant. In addition, mutation or strongly overexpression of SD37 results in dwarf plants but moderate overexpression increases plant height. These data suggest that CYP96B4 may be an important regulator of plant growth that affects plant height in rice. ",1,1,4,0,0

8446605,1993,"Four hypervariable loci were examined in DNA samples of American Blacks and Caucasians. Genetic diversity, measured by mean kinship within race, is 0.004 for a sliding window equal to twice the radius of coalescence of the autoradiographic bands. Kinship increases with the width of a window or bin, but it is an order of magnitude less than for blood groups and isozymes. This must reflect the greater mutability of hypervariable loci and absence of divergent selection. Low kinship implies that matching probabilities do not depend critically on race. Complete matching between pairs of loci shows deviations from independence, presumably because of inadvertent inclusion of replicated samples or related individuals. Multilocus matching probabilities were corrected for this (possibly spurious) dependence; the correction is negligible. When the complexities of coalescence, kinship, and dependent matching are allowed for, the probability calculations used in forensic identification are reliable. Recent counterarguments without theoretical basis or empirical support are discussed.",1,1,3,4,5

17616693,2007,"A major drawback of cancer chemotherapy is the lack of tumor-specific targets which would allow for the selective eradication of malignant cells without affecting healthy tissues. In contrast with normal cells, most tumor cells contain multiple centrosomes, associated with the formation of multipolar mitotic spindles and chromosome segregation defects. Many tumor cells regain mitotic stability after clonal selection by the coalescence of multiple centrosomes into two functional spindle poles. To overcome the limitations of current cancer treatments, we have developed a cell-based screening strategy to identify small molecules that inhibit centrosomal clustering and thus force tumor cells with supernumerary centrosomes to undergo multipolar mitoses, and subsequently, apoptosis. Using a chemotaxonomic selection of fungi from a large culture collection, a relatively small but diverse natural product extract library was generated. Screening of this compound library led to the identification of griseofulvin, which induced multipolar spindles by inhibition of centrosome coalescence, mitotic arrest, and subsequent cell death in tumor cell lines but not in diploid fibroblasts and keratinocytes with a normal centrosome content. The inhibition of centrosome clustering by griseofulvin was not restricted to mitotic cells but did occur during interphase as well. Whereas the formation of multipolar spindles was dynein-independent, depolymerization of interphase microtubules seemed to be mechanistically involved in centrosomal declustering. In summary, by taking advantage of the tumor-specific phenotype of centrosomal clustering, we have developed a screening strategy that might lead to the identification of drugs which selectively target tumor cells and spare healthy tissues.",1,0,1,0,1
17613554,2007,"Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the development of human tumors. However, the conventional analysis of neoplasias has preferentially focused on only one of these processes. This approach has led to a biased, primarily genetic view, of human tumorigenesis. Epigenetic alterations, such as aberrant DNA methylation, are sufficient to induce tumor formation, and can modify the incidence, and determine the type of tumor which will arise in genetic models of cancer. These observations raise important questions about the degree to which genetic and epigenetic mechanisms cooperate in human tumorigenesis, the identity of the specific cooperating genes and how these genes interact functionally to determine the diverse biological and clinical paths to tumor initiation and progression. These gaps in our knowledge are, in part, due to the lack of methods for full-scale integrated genetic and epigenetic analyses. The ultimate goal to fill these gaps would include sequencing relevant regions of the 3-billion nucleotide genome, and determining the methylation status of the 28-million CpG dinucleotide methylome at single nucleotide resolution in different types of neoplasias. Here, we review the emergence and advancement of technologies to map ever larger proportions of the cancer methylome, and the unique discovery potential of integrating these with cancer genomic data.

26527288,2015,"The dynamic cancer ecosystem, with its rich temporal and spatial diversity in environmental conditions and heritable cell phenotypes, is remarkably robust to therapeutic perturbations. Even when response to therapy is clinically complete, adaptive tumor strategies almost inevitably emerge and the tumor returns. Although evolution of resistance remains the proximate cause of death in most cancer patients, a recent analysis found that evolutionary terms were included in less than 1% of articles on the cancer treatment outcomes, and this has not changed in 30 years. Here, we review treatment methods that attempt to understand and exploit intratumoral evolution to prolong response to therapy. In general, we find that treating metastatic (i.e., noncurable) cancers using the traditional strategy aimed at killing the maximum number of tumor cells is evolutionarily unsound because, by eliminating all treatment-sensitive cells, it enables rapid proliferation of resistant populations-a well-known evolutionary phenomenon termed ""competitive release."" Alternative strategies, such as adaptive therapy, ""ersatzdroges,"" and double-bind treatments, shift focus from eliminating tumor cells to evolution-based methods that suppress growth of resistant populations to maintain long-term control.",1,0,1,0,0

Large between-species differences in the amount of DNA sequence polymorphism reflect breeding systems: selfing species show much less within-species polymorphism than outcrossing species.

Structural studies of the prototypical herpesviruses herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) entry glycoproteins have defined the interaction sites for glycoprotein complexes and receptors, and have revealed conformational changes that occur on receptor binding.

Women have >50% greater lifetime risk of dementia than men but the role of female-specific endocrine milieu is not well-understood. This study evaluates associations between indicators of estrogen exposure from women's reproductive period and dementia risk in a large diverse population.
METHODS:
We evaluated 15,754 female members (29.9% nonwhite) of Kaiser Permanente with clinical examinations and health survey data from 1964 to 1973 and were members as of January 1, 1996. In midlife (mean age 51.1 years), women reported age at menarche and menopause and hysterectomy status. Reproductive span was calculated as menopause age minus menarche age. Dementia diagnoses were abstracted from January 1, 1996 to September 30, 2017 medical records (mean age at start of dementia follow-up 76.5 years). Cox proportional hazard models evaluated associations between aspects of reproductive span and dementia risk adjusting for demographics and life course health indicators.
RESULTS:
Forty-two percent of women developed dementia. Compared to menarche at age 13.0 (mean menarche age), menarche at ≥16 was associated with 23% greater dementia risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.50) adjusting for demographics and life course health indicators. Natural menopause at age <47.4 (mean menopause age) was associated with 19% elevated dementia risk (HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.07-1.31). Reproductive spans <34.4 years (mean duration) were associated with 20% elevated dementia risk (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.08-1.32). Hysterectomies were associated with 8% elevated dementia risk (HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.16).
CONCLUSION:
In this large prospective cohort study, endocrine events signaling less estradiol exposure (i.e., later age at menarche, younger age at menopause, shorter reproductive span, and hysterectomies) were associated with elevated risk of dementia.

29921902,2018,"Hydrothermal vent fields are vulnerable to natural disturbances, such as volcanic activity, and are currently being considered as targets for mineral mining. Local vent communities are linked by pelagic larval dispersal and form regional metacommunities, nested within a number of biogeographic provinces. Larval supply depends on the connectivity of the dispersal networks, and affects recoverability of communities from disturbances. However, it is unclear how the dispersal networks contribute to recoverability of local communities. Here, we integrated a population dynamics model and estimation of large scale dispersal networks. By simulating disturbances to vent fields, we mapped recoverability of communities in 131 hydrothermal vent fields in the western Pacific Ocean. Our analysis showed substantial variation in recovery time due to variation in regional connectivity between known vent fields, and was not qualitatively affected by potential larval recruitment from unknown vent fields. In certain cases, simultaneous disturbance of a series of vent fields either delayed or wholly prevented recovery. Our approach is applicable to a dispersal network estimated from genetic diversity.

In contrast to the 'standard-mechanism' inhibitors, inhibitory serpins use a mechanism that involves unusual flexibility, and cofactor and receptor interactions. The principal feature is a refolding step, during which a disordered or helical strand is inserted into the center of a beta sheet. This transition, which is essential for inhibition, can be induced by heating, proteolytic cleavage of the serpin, or complexation with the proteinase target; analogous transitions can be induced by peptide complexation or aggregation.

We sought to define the influence of ethnicity on associations between novel biomarkers and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events among Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study participants, a community based population of asymptomatic US adults.
METHODS:
Baseline (log transformed) levels of biomarkers namely C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, interleukin-6 (IL-6), D-dimer, plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PAP) and factor VIII were used to predict the cumulative incidence of all CVD events in an ethnicity stratified study cohort from Cox-proportional hazard analysis where models were adjusted for relevant confounders.
RESULTS:
Ethnic cohorts included 2362 Caucasians, 1601 African Americans, 1353 Hispanics, and 751 Chinese. At mean 4.6 years of follow-up, 286 CVD events were identified with cumulative incidence of 11.3% in Caucasians, 9.8% in African Americans, 11.3% in Hispanics and 6.9% in Chinese. Biomarker risk association with CVD events incidence was significantly influenced by ethnicity with positive association (HR, 95% CI, p value) being shown for: CRP among Caucasians only (1.23, 1.04-1.47, <0.01) IL-6 among African Americans only (1.69, 1.15-2.48, <0.01) and fibrinogen among Caucasians (3.05, 1.21-7.69, 0.02), African Americans (3.51, 1.09-11.2, 0.03) and Hispanics (4.16, 1.23-14.1, 0.02) only. None of the biomarkers were able to predict CVD in Chinese. Association between above biomarkers and CVD was bi-directional: cases with CVD events had higher mean levels of biomarkers; cases in higher quartiles of biomarkers had increased cumulative incidence of CVD events.

We show that human midgestation c-Kit(-) lineage-committed amniotic cells (ACs) can be reprogrammed into vascular endothelial cells (rAC-VECs) without transitioning through a pluripotent state. Transient ETV2 expression in ACs generates immature rAC-VECs, whereas coexpression with FLI1/ERG1 endows rAC-VECs with a vascular repertoire and morphology matching mature endothelial cells (ECs). Brief TGFβ-inhibition functionalizes VEGFR2 signaling, augmenting specification of ACs into rAC-VECs. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses showed that rAC-VECs are similar to adult ECs in which vascular-specific genes are expressed and nonvascular genes are silenced. Functionally, rAC-VECs form stable vasculature in Matrigel plugs and regenerating livers. Therefore, short-term ETV2 expression and TGFβ inhibition with constitutive ERG1/FLI1 coexpression reprogram mature ACs into durable rAC-VECs with clinical-scale expansion potential. Banking of HLA-typed rAC-VECs establishes a vascular inventory for treatment of diverse disorders.",1,1,2,0,0
20498051,2010,"The fundamental chemistry of trace elements dictates the molecular speciation and reactivity both within cells and the environment at large. Using protein structure and comparative genomics, we elucidate several major influences this chemistry has had upon biology. All of life exhibits the same proteome size-dependent scaling for the number of metal-binding proteins within a proteome. This fundamental evolutionary constant shows that the selection of one element occurs at the exclusion of another, with the eschewal of Fe for Zn and Ca being a defining feature of eukaryotic proteomes. Early life lacked both the structures required to control intracellular metal concentrations and the metal-binding proteins that catalyze electron transport and redox transformations. The development of protein structures for metal homeostasis coincided with the emergence of metal-specific structures, which predominantly bound metals abundant in the Archean ocean. Potentially, this promoted the diversification of emerging lineages of Archaea and Bacteria through the establishment of biogeochemical cycles. In contrast, structures binding Cu and Zn evolved much later, providing further evidence that environmental availability influenced the selection of the elements. The late evolving Zn-binding proteins are fundamental to eukaryotic cellular biology, and Zn bioavailability may have been a limiting factor in eukaryotic evolution. The results presented here provide an evolutionary timeline based on genomic characteristics, and key hypotheses can be tested by alternative geochemical methods.",1,0,1,0,0

23487436,2013,"BACKGROUND:
Decades-old animal experiments suggested that dietary long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (LCMUFAs) caused cardiotoxicity, leading, for example, development of Canola oil (Canadian oil low in erucic acid) from rapeseed. However, potential cardiotoxicity in humans and contemporary dietary sources of LCMUFAs are unknown.
RESULTS:
We prospectively investigated the associations of plasma phospholipid LCMUFAs (20:1, 22:1, and 24:1), assessed as objective biomarkers of exposure, with incidence congestive heart failure in 2 independent cohorts: 3694 older adults (mean age, 75.2±5.2 years) in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 1992-2006) and 3577 middle-aged adults (mean age, 54.1±5.8 years) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Minnesota subcohort (ARIC; 1987-2008). We further examined dietary correlates of circulating LCMUFAs in CHS and ARIC and US dietary sources of LCMUFAs in the 2003-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In CHS, 997 congestive heart failure events occurred during 39 238 person-years; in ARIC, 330 events congestive heart failure events occurred during 64 438 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, higher levels of 22:1 and 24:1 were positively associated with greater incident congestive heart failure in both CHS and ARIC; hazard ratios were 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.76) and 1.57 (95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.23) for highest versus lowest quintiles of 22:1, respectively, and 1.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-2.50) and 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.22-3.03) for 24:1, respectively (P for trend ≤0.03 each). A variety of foods were related to circulating LCMUFAs in CHS and ARIC, consistent with food sources of LCMUFAs in NHANES, including fish, poultry, meats, whole grains, and mustard.
CONCLUSIONS:
Higher circulating levels of 22:1 and 24:1, with apparently diverse dietary sources, were associated with incident congestive heart failure in 2 independent cohorts, suggesting possible cardiotoxicity of LCMUFAs in humans.

22307944,2012,"Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an important enzyme involved in folate metabolism and catalyzes methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate to deoxythymidine monophosphate, which is essential for DNA replication. Thymidylate synthase enhancer region (TSER) and TS1494del6, two functionally important and ethnically diverse polymorphisms mapping to its gene region, are the most extensively studied. Considering the potential influence of altering TS activity, it is plausible that TS polymorphisms might play a role in the development of cancer. Although the effects of TS polymorphisms on susceptibility to human cancer have been investigated in many studies, the results remain conflicting rather than conclusive. To resolve these conflicts, we performed a quantitative synthesis of the evidence on the association between these two polymorphisms and cancer risk, including 63 studies (19,707 cases and 27,398 controls) for TSER polymorphism and 39 studies (13,489 cases and 16,297 controls) for TS1494del6 polymorphism. Our meta-analysis suggested that these two polymorphisms are not associated with cancer risk when all studies were pooled together. In the stratified analyses, we found that individuals with 2R/2R genotype had a significantly higher cancer risks among Asians (2R/2R vs. 3R/3R: odds ratio [OR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.05-1.45; recessive model: OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.05-1.44). Further analyses revealed that 2R/2R genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of gastroesophageal cancer among Asians, whereas it might provide protecting effects against colorectal cancer risk in a dominant genetic model for Caucasians.

12198498,2002,"The yeast protein Rad23 belongs to a diverse family of proteins that contain an amino-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain. This domain mediates the binding of Rad23 to proteasomes, which in turn promotes DNA repair and modulates protein degradation, possibly by delivering ubiquitinylated cargo to proteasomes. Here we show that Rad23 binds proteasomes by directly interacting with the base subcomplex of the regulatory particle of the proteasome. A component of the base, Rpn1, specifically recognizes the UBL domain of Rad23 through its leucine-rich-repeat-like (LRR-like) domain. A second UBL protein, Dsk2, competes with Rad23 for proteasome binding, which suggests that the LRR-like domain of Rpn1 may participate in the recognition of several ligands of the proteasome. We propose that the LRR domain of Rpn1 may be positioned in the base to allow the cargo proteins carried by Rad23 to be presented to the proteasomal ATPases for unfolding. We also report that, contrary to expectation, the base subunit Rpn10 does not mediate the binding of UBL proteins to the proteasome in yeast, although it can apparently contribute to the binding of ubiquitin chains by intact proteasomes.",1,0,1,0,0
15734351,2005,"Fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) provides a parsimonious model for stationary increments of a self-similar process parameterised by the Hurst exponent, H, and variance, sigma2. Fractional Gaussian noise with H < 0.5 demonstrates negatively autocorrelated or antipersistent behaviour; fGn with H > 0.5 demonstrates 1/f, long memory or persistent behaviour; and the special case of fGn with H = 0.5 corresponds to classical Gaussian white noise. We comparatively evaluate four possible estimators of fGn parameters, one method implemented in the time domain and three in the wavelet domain. We show that a wavelet-based maximum likelihood (ML) estimator yields the most efficient estimates of H and sigma2 in simulated fGn with 0 < H < 1. Applying this estimator to fMRI data acquired in the ""resting"" state from healthy young and older volunteers, we show empirically that fGn provides an accommodating model for diverse species of fMRI noise, assuming adequate preprocessing to correct effects of head movement, and that voxels with H > 0.5 tend to be concentrated in cortex whereas voxels with H < 0.5 are more frequently located in ventricles and sulcal CSF. The wavelet-ML estimator can be generalised to estimate the parameter vector beta for general linear modelling (GLM) of a physiological response to experimental stimulation and we demonstrate nominal type I error control in multiple testing of beta, divided by its standard error, in simulated and biological data under the null hypothesis beta = 0. We illustrate these methods principally by showing that there are significant differences between patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched comparison subjects in the persistence of fGn in the medial and lateral temporal lobes, insula, dorsal cingulate/medial premotor cortex, and left pre- and postcentral gyrus: patients with AD had greater persistence of resting fMRI noise (larger H) in these regions. Comparable abnormalities in the AD patients were also identified by a permutation test of local differences in the first-order autoregression AR(1) coefficient, which was significantly more positive in patients. However, we found that the Hurst exponent provided a more sensitive metric than the AR(1) coefficient to detect these differences, perhaps because neurophysiological changes in early AD are naturally better described in terms of abnormal salience of long memory dynamics than a change in the strength of association between immediately consecutive time points. We conclude that parsimonious mapping of fMRI noise properties in terms of fGn parameters efficiently estimated in the wavelet domain is feasible and can enhance insight into the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.",1,1,4,0,0
10612695,1999,"Neuropeptides are used as signaling molecules in the nervous system of most organisms, including mammals. The family of FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2)-like neuropeptides (FaRPs) all share an RFamide sequence at their C-termini and have been shown to have diverse functions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, FMRFamide-like peptides (FaRPs) are expressed in at least 10% of the neurons, including motor, sensory, and interneurons that are involved in movement, feeding, defecation, and reproduction. Twenty-two genes, designated flp-1 through flp-22, encode FaRPs in C. elegans, although there are likely to be additional flp genes to be identified. Each flp gene encodes a different set of FaRPs, yielding a predicted total of 59 distinct FaRPs; a few of the genes may also encode non-FaRPs. Inactivation of some of the flp genes indicates that at least one flp gene has unique functions, while at least two flp genes appear to have overlapping functions with other flp genes. These results suggest that a complex family of FaRPs have varied roles through all stages of development and in adulthood in C. elegans.",1,1,2,0,0
20976248,2010,"A remarkable characteristic of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is its extreme genetic diversity, which is maintained by balancing selection. In fact, the MHC complex remains one of the best-known examples of natural selection in humans, with well-established genetic signatures and biological mechanisms for the action of selection. Here, we present genetic and functional evidence that another gene with a fundamental role in MHC class I presentation, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2), has also evolved under balancing selection and contains a variant that affects antigen presentation. Specifically, genetic analyses of six human populations revealed strong and consistent signatures of balancing selection affecting ERAP2. This selection maintains two highly differentiated haplotypes (Haplotype A and Haplotype B), with frequencies 0.44 and 0.56, respectively. We found that ERAP2 expressed from Haplotype B undergoes differential splicing and encodes a truncated protein, leading to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA. To investigate the consequences of ERAP2 deficiency on MHC presentation, we correlated surface MHC class I expression with ERAP2 genotypes in primary lymphocytes. Haplotype B homozygotes had lower levels of MHC class I expressed on the surface of B cells, suggesting that naturally occurring ERAP2 deficiency affects MHC presentation and immune response. Interestingly, an ERAP2 paralog, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), also shows genetic signatures of balancing selection. Together, our findings link the genetic signatures of selection with an effect on splicing and a cellular phenotype. Although the precise selective pressure that maintains polymorphism is unknown, the demonstrated differences between the ERAP2 splice forms provide important insights into the potential mechanism for the action of selection.",1,0,1,0,0
26559682,2015,"Calculation of cleavage entropies allows to quantify, map and compare protease substrate specificity by an information entropy based approach. The metric intrinsically depends on the number of experimentally determined substrates (data points). Thus a statistical analysis of its numerical stability is crucial to estimate the systematic error made by estimating specificity based on a limited number of substrates. In this contribution, we show the mathematical basis for estimating the uncertainty in cleavage entropies. Sets of cleavage entropies are calculated using experimental cleavage data and modeled extreme cases. By analyzing the underlying mathematics and applying statistical tools, a linear dependence of the metric in respect to 1/n was found. This allows us to extrapolate the values to an infinite number of samples and to estimate the errors. Analyzing the errors, a minimum number of 30 substrates was found to be necessary to characterize substrate specificity, in terms of amino acid variability, for a protease (S4-S4') with an uncertainty of 5 percent. Therefore, we encourage experimental researchers in the protease field to record specificity profiles of novel proteases aiming to identify at least 30 peptide substrates of maximum sequence diversity. We expect a full characterization of protease specificity helpful to rationalize biological functions of proteases and to assist rational drug design. ",1,0,1,0,0

Using a population genetics scoring model, we identified 55 million SNPs in 103 lines across pre-domestication and domesticated Zea mays varieties, including a representative from the sister genus Tripsacum. We find that structural variations are pervasive in the Z. mays genome and are enriched at loci associated with important traits. By investigating the drivers of genome size variation, we find that the larger Tripsacum genome can be explained by transposable element abundance rather than an allopolyploid origin. In contrast, intraspecies genome size variation seems to be controlled by chromosomal knob content. There is tremendous overlap in key gene content in maize and Tripsacum, suggesting that adaptations from Tripsacum (for example, perennialism and frost and drought tolerance) can likely be integrated into maize.",1,0,1,0,0

31349857,2019,"BACKGROUND:
Although mosaic variation has been known to cause disease for decades, high-throughput sequencing technologies with the analytical sensitivity to consistently detect variants at reduced allelic fractions have only recently emerged as routine clinical diagnostic tests. To date, few systematic analyses of mosaic variants detected by diagnostic exome sequencing for diverse clinical indications have been performed.
METHODS:
To investigate the frequency, type, allelic fraction, and phenotypic consequences of clinically relevant somatic mosaic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and characteristics of the corresponding genes, we retrospectively queried reported mosaic variants from a cohort of ~ 12,000 samples submitted for clinical exome sequencing (ES) at Baylor Genetics.
RESULTS:
We found 120 mosaic variants involving 107 genes, including 80 mosaic SNVs in proband samples and 40 in parental/grandparental samples. Average mosaic alternate allele fraction (AAF) detected in autosomes and in X-linked disease genes in females was 18.2% compared with 34.8% in X-linked disease genes in males. Of these mosaic variants, 74 variants (61.7%) were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and 46 (38.3%) as variants of uncertain significance. Mosaic variants occurred in disease genes associated with autosomal dominant (AD) or AD/autosomal recessive (AR) (67/120, 55.8%), X-linked (33/120, 27.5%), AD/somatic (10/120, 8.3%), and AR (8/120, 6.7%) inheritance. Of note, 1.7% (2/120) of variants were found in genes in which only somatic events have been described. Nine genes had recurrent mosaic events in unrelated individuals which accounted for 18.3% (22/120) of all detected mosaic variants in this study. The proband group was enriched for mosaicism affecting Ras signaling pathway genes.
CONCLUSIONS:
In sum, an estimated 1.5% of all molecular diagnoses made in this cohort could be attributed to a mosaic variant detected in the proband, while parental mosaicism was identified in 0.3% of families analyzed. As ES design favors breadth over depth of coverage, this estimate of the prevalence of mosaic variants likely represents an underestimate of the total number of clinically relevant mosaic variants in our cohort.

The aim of the study was to elicit beliefs about hypertension among Nigerian immigrants in the United Kingdom.
BACKGROUND:
The distributions of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases are not shared equally across ethnic and economic groups in the United Kingdom. Its burden is more clustered among minority ethnic populations and migrant groups including black African Nigerian migrants. Similar patterns have been reported across Europe, Australia, Canada, Nordic countries and the United States of America. There are about 300 distinct ethnic groups in Nigeria and reliable information about their beliefs about hypertension is not available. Given that the United Kingdom has a large community of Nigerian immigrants from these different ethno-cultural backgrounds, understanding their unique beliefs about hypertension may help promote appropriate care for this population in the United Kingdom and Nigeria.
METHODS:
A single Pentecostal church community in West London.
METHODS:
Twenty-seven Nigerian migrant members of the church entered and completed the study.
UNASSIGNED:
A qualitative interview study was conducted. The interviews were analysed using thematic framework analysis. The outcome measures were emerging themes from the thematic framework analysis.
RESULTS:
Participants expressed beliefs in four major areas related to hypertension: (1) The Meaning of the term hypertension, (2) Perceptions of causation, (3) Effects of hypertension, and (4) Perceptions of treatment. The study revealed a diversity of beliefs about hypertension which incorporated both orthodox and culturally framed ideas.

To describe patterns of diagnostic testing and antibiotic management of uncomplicated pneumonia in general community hospitals and children's hospitals within hospitals and to determine the association between diagnostic testing and length of hospital stay.
METHODS:
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children 1-17 years of age hospitalized with the diagnosis of pneumonia from 2007 to 2010 to hospitals contributing data to Perspective Database Warehouse, assessing patterns of diagnostic testing and antibiotic management. We constructed logistic regression models of log-transformed length of stay (LOS) and grouped treatment models to ascertain whether performance of blood cultures and viral respiratory testing were associated with LOS.
RESULTS:
A total of 17 299 pneumonia cases occurred at 125 hospitals, with considerable variability in pneumonia management. Only 40 (0.2%) received ampicillin/penicillin G alone or in combination with other antibiotics, and 1318 (7.4%) received macrolide monotherapy as initial antibiotic management. Performance of blood culture and testing for respiratory viruses was associated with a statistically significant longer LOS, but these differences did not persist in grouped treatment models.

29440426,2018,"In mammalian cells, IFN responses that occur during RNA and DNA virus infections are activated by distinct signaling pathways. The RIG-I-like-receptors (RLRs) bind viral RNA and engage the adaptor MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) to promote IFN expression, whereas cGAS (cGMP-AMP synthase) binds viral DNA and activates an analogous pathway via the protein STING (stimulator of IFN genes). In this study, we confirm that STING is not necessary to induce IFN expression during RNA virus infection but also find that STING is required to restrict the replication of diverse RNA viruses. The antiviral activities of STING were not linked to its ability to regulate basal expression of IFN-stimulated genes, activate transcription, or autophagy. Using vesicular stomatitis virus as a model, we identified a requirement of STING to inhibit translation during infection and upon transfection of synthetic RLR ligands. This inhibition occurs at the level of translation initiation and restricts the production of viral and host proteins. The inability to restrict translation rendered STING-deficient cells 100 times more likely to support productive viral infections than wild-type counterparts. Genetic analysis linked RNA sensing by RLRs to STING-dependent translation inhibition, independent of MAVS. Thus, STING has dual functions in host defense, regulating protein synthesis to prevent RNA virus infection and regulating IFN expression to restrict DNA viruses.",1,0,1,0,0
30486770,2018,"BACKGROUND:
Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease with diverse clinical phenotypes, determined by parasite, host and vector interactions. Despite the advances in molecular biology and the availability of more Leishmania genome references in recent years, the association between parasite species and distinct clinical phenotypes remains poorly understood. We present a genomic comparison of an atypical variant of Leishmania donovani from a South Asian focus, where it mostly causes cutaneous form of leishmaniasis.
RESULTS:
Clinical isolates from six cutaneous leishmaniasis patients (CL-SL); 2 of whom were poor responders to antimony (CL-PR), and two visceral leishmaniasis patients (VL-SL) were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Chromosome aneuploidy was observed in both groups but was more frequent in CL-SL. 248 genes differed by 2 fold or more in copy number among the two groups. Genes involved in amino acid use (LdBPK_271940) and energy metabolism (LdBPK_271950), predominated the VL-SL group with the same distribution pattern reflected in gene tandem arrays. Genes encoding amastins were present in higher copy numbers in VL-SL and CL-PR as well as being among predicted pseudogenes in CL-SL. Both chromosome and SNP profiles showed CL-SL and VL-SL to form two distinct groups. While expected heterozygosity was much higher in VL-SL, SNP allele frequency patterns did not suggest potential recent recombination breakpoints. The SNP/indel profile obtained using the more recently generated PacBio sequence did not vary markedly from that based on the standard LdBPK282A1 reference. Several genes previously associated with resistance to antimonials were observed in higher copy numbers in the analysis of CL-PR. H-locus amplification was seen in one cutaneous isolate which however did not belong to the CL-PR group.
CONCLUSIONS:
The data presented suggests that intra species variations at chromosome and gene level are more likely to influence differences in tropism as well as response to treatment, and contributes to greater understanding of parasite molecular mechanisms underpinning these differences. These findings should be substantiated with a larger sample number and expression/functional studies.

To do this, a collaborative screening study was set up that involved 39 institutions from 19 countries and included 3,580 unrelated individuals with a family history of the disease and 934 early-onset breast and/or ovarian cancer cases. A total of 11 additional families carrying this mutation were identified in Australia (1), Belgium (1), Canada (1), Great Britain (6), and the United States (2). Haplotyping showed that they are likely to derive from a common ancestor, possibly of northern British origin. Our results demonstrate that it is strongly advisable, for laboratories carrying out screening either in English-speaking countries or in countries with historical links with Britain, to include within their BRCA1 screening protocols the polymerase chain reaction-based assay described in this report.",1,0,1,0,6
9192815,1997,"Tumor cells grown as multicellular spheroids are known to be intrinsically more resistant to a large and diverse array of anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs compared to the same cells grown as dispersed monolayer cell cultures. Some drugs, however, seem relatively insensitive to this multicellular drug resistance, e.g., cisplatinum. Whether the cytotoxic effects of Taxol, an anticancer drug of growing importance in the treatment of breast and ovarian carcinomas, are diminished by multicellular growth conditions is unknown. To study this question, we examined the relative sensitivity of a panel of four different human ovarian carcinoma cell lines to either Taxol or cisplatinum. Upon exposure to Taxol, all the cell lines manifested a relative drug-resistant phenotype when grown as multicellular tumor spheroids, compared to the same cells grown as sparse monolayer cultures. This multicellular-dependent drug-resistant phenotype was not observed when the same cells were exposed to cisplatinum for an equivalent length of time. Monolayer but not spheroid cultures exposed to Taxol demonstrated an accumulation of cells at G2-M and a sub-G1 apoptotic region. In addition, Taxol-induced apoptosis was detected in monolayer conditions but not in the spheroid cultures. The relative sensitivity of the monolayer cell cultures was associated with a decrease in bcl-X(L) protein levels after Taxol exposure, an effect not observed in drug-exposed spheroids. Taken together, these results suggest that some aspects of intrinsic Taxol resistance in ovarian carcinoma may be due to multicellular-dependent or -associated mechanisms. This raises the possibility of using antiadhesive agents to reverse multicellular-dependent Taxol resistance in certain circumstances as a potential means of increasing the initial efficiency of Taxol therapy against ovarian carcinoma.",1,0,1,0,0
27643539,2016,"Meiotic recombination involves a combination of gene conversion and crossover events that, along with mutations, produce germline genetic diversity. Here we report the discovery of 3,176 SNP and 61 indel gene conversions. Our estimate of the non-crossover (NCO) gene conversion rate (G) is 7.0 for SNPs and 5.8 for indels per megabase per generation, and the GC bias is 67.6%. For indels, we demonstrate a 65.6% preference for the shorter allele. NCO gene conversions from mothers are longer than those from fathers, and G is 2.17 times greater in mothers. Notably, G increases with the age of mothers, but not the age of fathers. A disproportionate number of NCO gene conversions in older mothers occur outside double-strand break (DSB) regions and in regions with relatively low GC content. This points to age-related changes in the mechanisms of meiotic gene conversion in oocytes.",1,1,4,0,0
17122084,2006,"Recent reports indicate that copy number variations (CNVs) within the human genome contribute to nucleotide diversity to a larger extent than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, the contribution of CNVs to human disease susceptibility may be greater than previously expected, although a complete understanding of the phenotypic consequences of CNVs is incomplete. We have recently reported a comprehensive view of CNVs among 270 HapMap samples using high-density SNP genotyping arrays and BAC array CGH. In this report, we describe a novel algorithm using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Early Access (500K EA) arrays that identified 1203 CNVs ranging in size from 960 bp to 3.4 Mb. The algorithm consists of three steps: (1) Intensity pre-processing to improve the resolution between pairwise comparisons by directly estimating the allele-specific affinity as well as to reduce signal noise by incorporating probe and target sequence characteristics via an improved version of the Genomic Imbalance Map (GIM) algorithm; (2) CNV extraction using an adapted SW-ARRAY procedure to automatically and robustly detect candidate CNV regions; and (3) copy number inference in which all pairwise comparisons are summarized to more precisely define CNV boundaries and accurately estimate CNV copy number. Independent testing of a subset of CNVs by quantitative PCR and mass spectrometry demonstrated a >90% verification rate. The use of high-resolution oligonucleotide arrays relative to other methods may allow more precise boundary information to be extracted, thereby enabling a more accurate analysis of the relationship between CNVs and other genomic features.",1,0,1,0,0
32428606,2020,"The formation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters at the postsynaptic muscle membrane in response to motor innervation is a key event in the development of the neuromuscular junction. The synaptic AChR clustering process is initiated by motor axon-released agrin, which activates a tyrosine kinase-based signaling pathway to cause AChR aggregation. In cultured muscle cells, AChR clustering is elicited by diverse nonneural signals, and this process is also mediated by tyrosine kinases. Conversely, the formation of new AChR clusters induced by innervation or nonneural stimuli is unfailingly associated with the dispersal of pre-existing AChR clusters, and this process is mediated by tyrosine phosphatases. In this review, we address how local kinase activation leads to global phosphatase action in muscle. More specifically, we discuss the roles of Src kinase and the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 in establishing a regenerative mechanism to propagate the AChR cluster dispersing signal extrasynaptically and in defining the boundary of cluster formation subsynaptically.",1,0,1,0,0

26950748,2016,"Poly(lactate-co-glycolate) (PLGA) is a widely used biodegradable and biocompatible synthetic polymer. Here we report one-step fermentative production of PLGA in engineered Escherichia coli harboring an evolved polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase that polymerizes D-lactyl-CoA and glycolyl-CoA into PLGA. Introduction of the Dahms pathway enables production of glycolate from xylose. Deletion of ptsG enables simultaneous utilization of glucose and xylose. An evolved propionyl-CoA transferase converts D-lactate and glycolate to D-lactyl-CoA and glycolyl-CoA, respectively. Deletion of adhE, frdB, pflB and poxB prevents by-product formation. We also demonstrate modulation of the monomer fractions in PLGA by overexpressing ldhA and deleting dld to increase the proportion of D-lactate or by deleting aceB, glcB, glcD, glcE, glcF and glcG to increase the proportion of glycolate. Incorporation of 2-hydroxybutyrate is prevented by deleting ilvA or feeding strains with L-isoleucine. The utility of our approach for generating diverse forms of PLGA is shown by the production of copolymers containing 3-hydroxybutyrate, 4-hydroxybutyrate or 2-hydroxyisovalerate. ",1,0,1,0,0
30226842,2018,"BACKGROUND:
Helping consumers make healthier food choices is a key issue for the prevention of cancer and other diseases. In many countries, political authorities are considering the implementation of a simplified labelling system to reflect the nutritional quality of food products. The Nutri-Score, a five-colour nutrition label, is derived from the Nutrient Profiling System of the British Food Standards Agency (modified version) (FSAm-NPS). How the consumption of foods with high/low FSAm-NPS relates to cancer risk has been studied in national/regional cohorts but has not been characterized in diverse European populations.
METHODS AND FINDINGS:
This prospective analysis included 471,495 adults from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC, 1992-2014, median follow-up: 15.3 y), among whom there were 49,794 incident cancer cases (main locations: breast, n = 12,063; prostate, n = 6,745; colon-rectum, n = 5,806). Usual food intakes were assessed with standardized country-specific diet assessment methods. The FSAm-NPS was calculated for each food/beverage using their 100-g content in energy, sugar, saturated fatty acid, sodium, fibres, proteins, and fruits/vegetables/legumes/nuts. The FSAm-NPS scores of all food items usually consumed by a participant were averaged to obtain the individual FSAm-NPS Dietary Index (DI) scores. Multi-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were computed. A higher FSAm-NPS DI score, reflecting a lower nutritional quality of the food consumed, was associated with a higher risk of total cancer (HRQ5 versus Q1 = 1.07; 95% CI 1.03-1.10, P-trend < 0.001). Absolute cancer rates in those with high and low (quintiles 5 and 1) FSAm-NPS DI scores were 81.4 and 69.5 cases/10,000 person-years, respectively. Higher FSAm-NPS DI scores were specifically associated with higher risks of cancers of the colon-rectum, upper aerodigestive tract and stomach, lung for men, and liver and postmenopausal breast for women (all P < 0.05). The main study limitation is that it was based on an observational cohort using self-reported dietary data obtained through a single baseline food frequency questionnaire; thus, exposure misclassification and residual confounding cannot be ruled out.
CONCLUSIONS:
In this large multinational European cohort, the consumption of food products with a higher FSAm-NPS score (lower nutritional quality) was associated with a higher risk of cancer. This supports the relevance of the FSAm-NPS as underlying nutrient profiling system for front-of-pack nutrition labels, as well as for other public health nutritional measures.

There have been no published reports detailing patients who have remained radiation caries-free following radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between salivary function, oral microbiota and the absence of radiation caries. Twelve radiation caries-free patients and nine patients exhibiting radiation caries following irradiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma were selected. V40, the dose at which the volume of the contralateral parotid gland receives more than 40 Gy, was recorded. Stimulated saliva flow rate, pH values and buffering capacity were examined to assess salivary function. Stimulated saliva was used for molecular profiling by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. Mutans streptococci and Lactobacilli in saliva were also cultivated. There were no significant differences in V40 between radiation caries-free individuals and those with radiation caries. Compared with normal values, the radiation caries-free group had significantly decreased simulated saliva flow rate, while there were no significant differences in the saliva pH value and buffering capacity. Similar results were observed in the radiation caries group. There was no statistical difference in microbial diversity, composition and log CFU counts in cultivation from the radiation caries-free group and the radiation caries group. Eleven genera were detected in these two groups, among which Streptococcus spp. and Neisseria spp. had the highest distribution. Our results suggest that changes in salivary function and in salivary microbiota do not explain the absence of radiation caries in radiation caries-free individuals. ",1,0,1,0,0

Most of the newly formed neurons differentiated toward a GABAergic fate. This touch-induced neurogenesis reflected the novelty of the stimuli, its diversity, as well as stimulus duration.

It could increase transcriptome and proteome diversity through recoding the genomic information and cross-linking other regulatory events, such as those mediated by alternative splicing, RNAi and microRNA (miRNA). Previous studies indicated that RNA editing can occur in a tissue-specific manner in response to the requirements of the local environment. We set out to systematically detect tissue-specific A-to-I RNA editing sites in 43 human tissues using bioinformatics approaches based on the Fisher's exact test and the Benjamini & Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction. Twenty-three sites in total were identified to be tissue-specific. One of them resulted in an altered amino acid residue which may prevent the phosphorylation of PARP-10 and affect its activity. Eight and two tissue-specific A-to-I RNA editing sites were predicted to destroy putative exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and exonic splicing silencers (ESSs), respectively. Brain-specific and ovary-specific A-to-I RNA editing sites were further verified by comparing the cDNA sequences with their corresponding genomic templates in multiple cell lines from brain, colon, breast, bone marrow, lymph, liver, ovary and kidney tissue.

Diapause is a complex phenotype, and FOXO emerges as a prime candidate for activating many of the diverse physiological pathways that generate the diapause phenotype. Here, we used ChIP sequencing to identify direct targets of FOXO. The nearest gene in a 10-kb region surrounding a predicted binding site was extracted for each binding site, resulting in a dataset containing genes potentially regulated by FOXO. By selecting candidate genes based on their functional relevance to diapause, we identified five gene categories of potential interest, including stress tolerance, metabolic pathways, lifespan extension, cell cycle and growth regulation, and circadian rhythms. Twelve targets were prioritized for further analysis, 10 of which were validated by ChIP-quantitative PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. These 10 genes activated by FOXO are highly up-regulated during diapause and are thus strong candidates for implementation of the diapause syndrome. ",1,1,2,0,0

29440520,2018,"In the study of cultural evolution, observed among-group affinity patterns reflect the effects of processes such as mutation (e.g. innovation and copying error), between-group interaction (culture flow), drift and selection. As in biology, cultural affinity patterns are often spatially correlated, making it difficult to distinguish between the opposing geographically mediated forces of divergence and interaction, which cause groups to become more distinct or similar over time, respectively. Analogous difficulties are faced by evolutionary biologists examining the relationship between biological affinity and geography, particularly at lower taxonomic levels where the potential for gene flow between lineages is greatest. Tree models are generally used to assess the fit between affinity patterns and models of historical divergence. However, factors driving lineage divergence are often spatially mediated, resulting in tree models that are themselves geographically structured. Here, we showcase a simple method drawn from evolutionary ecology for assessing the relative impact of both geographically mediated processes simultaneously. We illustrate the method using global human craniometric diversity and material culture from the northern coast of New Guinea as example case studies. This method can be employed to quantify the relative importance of history (divergence) and geographically mediated between-group interaction (culture flow) in explaining observed cultural affinity patterns.This article is part of the theme issue 'Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution'.",1,1,6,0,2

26585283,2015,"Species extinction rates due to human activities are high, and initial extinctions can trigger cascades of secondary extinctions, leading to further erosion of biodiversity. A potential major mechanism for secondary extinction cascades is provided by the long-standing theory that the diversity of consumer species is maintained due to the positive indirect effects that these species have on each other by reducing competition among their respective resource species. This means that the loss of one carnivore species could lead to competitive exclusion at the prey trophic level, leading to extinctions of further carnivore species. Evidence for these effects is difficult to obtain due to many confounding factors in natural systems, but extinction cascades that could be due to this mechanism have been demonstrated in simplified laboratory microcosms. We established complex insect food webs in replicated field mesocosms and found that the overharvesting of one parasitoid wasp species caused increased extinction rates of other parasitoid species, compared to controls, but only when we manipulated the spatial distribution of herbivore species such that the potential for interspecific competition at this level was high. This provides clear evidence for horizontal extinction cascades at high trophic levels due to the proposed mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the loss of carnivores can have widespread effects on other species at the same trophic level due to indirect population-dynamic effects that are rarely considered in this context.",1,0,1,0,0

Although the pdmH1N1 demonstrated less lethality than initially expected and has now moved into its post-pandemic period, it remains highly possible that through antigenic shift or antigenic drift the pdmH1N1 might re-emerge in the future as a more virulent strain than before, underscoring the need for vaccination prior to an outbreak. Using X-31 ca as a backbone strain, we generated a live attenuated pdmH1N1 vaccine and evaluated its potential as a safe and effective vaccine using mouse and ferret models. Despite an acceptable level of attenuation phenotypes, single dose of immunization with the vaccine efficiently stimulated both systemic and mucosal antibody responses and provided complete protection against lethal challenge with wild type pdmH1N1 virus, even at the lowest immunization dose of 10(3)PFU. The promising results of safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the vaccine not only contribute to expanding the repertoire of live vaccines as a judicious choice for pandemic H1N1 preparedness, but also suggest the great potential of X-31 ca donor strain to serve as reliable platform for generating diverse live vaccine constructs against seasonal influenza viruses and other pandemic strains.",1,1,3,0,0

To replicate this dynamics of replacement current models utilize mechanisms such as short-lived strain-transcending immunity, a direct competition for hosts, stochastic extinction or constrained antigenic evolution. Building on the idea of short-lived immunity we introduce a minimal model that exhibits the aforementioned dynamics of replacement.

29531165,2018,"B lymphocytes migrate among varied microenvironmental niches during diversification, selection, and conversion to memory or Ab-secreting plasma cells. Aspects of the nutrient milieu differ within these lymphoid microenvironments and can influence signaling molecules such as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, much remains to be elucidated as to the B cell-intrinsic functions of nutrient-sensing signal transducers that modulate B cell differentiation or Ab affinity. We now show that the amino acid-sensing mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is vital for induction of Bcl6-a key transcriptional regulator of the germinal center (GC) fate-in activated B lymphocytes. Accordingly, disruption of mTORC1 after B cell development and activation led to reduced populations of Ag-specific memory B cells as well as plasma cells and GC B cells. In addition, induction of the germ line transcript that guides activation-induced deaminase in selection of the IgG1 H chain region during class switching required mTORC1. Expression of the somatic mutator activation-induced deaminase was reduced by a lack of mTORC1 in B cells, whereas point mutation frequencies in Ag-specific GC-phenotype B cells were only halved. These effects culminated in a B cell-intrinsic defect that impacted an antiviral Ab response and drastically impaired generation of high-affinity IgG1. Collectively, these data establish that mTORC1 governs critical B cell-intrinsic mechanisms essential for establishment of GC differentiation and effective Ab production.",1,0,1,0,0

22135472,2011,"Viruses can create complex genetic populations within a host, and deep sequencing technologies allow extensive sampling of these populations. Limitations of these technologies, however, potentially bias this sampling, particularly when a PCR step precedes the sequencing protocol. Typically, an unknown number of templates are used in initiating the PCR amplification, and this can lead to unrecognized sequence resampling creating apparent homogeneity; also, PCR-mediated recombination can disrupt linkage, and differential amplification can skew allele frequency. Finally, misincorporation of nucleotides during PCR and errors during the sequencing protocol can inflate diversity. We have solved these problems by including a random sequence tag in the initial primer such that each template receives a unique Primer ID. After sequencing, repeated identification of a Primer ID reveals sequence resampling. These resampled sequences are then used to create an accurate consensus sequence for each template, correcting for recombination, allelic skewing, and misincorporation/sequencing errors. The resulting population of consensus sequences directly represents the initial sampled templates. We applied this approach to the HIV-1 protease (pro) gene to view the distribution of sequence variation of a complex viral population within a host. We identified major and minor polymorphisms at coding and noncoding positions.

Directors of the 11 New York cystic fibrosis centers were asked to provide mutation data, demographic data, and selected laboratory results for each patient diagnosed by newborn screening and followed at their center. Summary data were also submitted from the New York newborn screening laboratory on the total number of patients screened, the number of positive screens, and the number of patients that were lost to follow-up. A second survey was submitted by each center regarding the availability of genetic counseling services at the center.
RESULTS:
A total of 106 patients with cystic fibrosis were diagnosed through newborn screening in the first 2.5 years and followed at the 11 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation-sponsored cystic fibrosis care centers in New York. Two screen-negative infants were subsequently diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when symptoms developed. The allele frequency of deltaF508 was 57.4%, which is somewhat lower than the allele frequency of deltaF508 in the US cystic fibrosis population of 70%. There were 90 non-Hispanic white (84%), 12 Hispanic, 2 Asian, and 1 black infants diagnosed with cystic fibrosis during this period. Five patients were diagnosed secondary to a positive screen based on a high immunoreactive trypsinogen and no mutations.
CONCLUSIONS:
Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis has been effectively conducted in New York using a unique screening algorithm that was designed to be inclusive of the diverse racial makeup of the state. However, this algorithm results in a high false-positive rate, and a large number of healthy newborns are referred for confirmatory sweat tests and genetic counseling. This experience indicates that it would be helpful to convene a working group of cystic fibrosis newborn screening specialists to evaluate which mutations should be included in a newborn screening panel.

30217559,2018,"Different types of monoallelic gene expression are present in mammals, some of which are highly flexible, whereas others are more rigid. These include allelic exclusion at antigen receptor loci, the expression of olfactory receptor genes, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and random monoallelic expression (MAE). Although these processes play diverse biological roles, and arose through different selective pressures, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms show striking resemblances. Regulatory transcriptional events are important in all systems, particularly in the specification of MAE. Combined with comparative studies between species, this suggests that the different MAE systems found in mammals may have evolved from analogous ancestral processes.",1,0,1,0,0
29203504,2017,"OBJECTIVE:
ABO and RhD blood groups are key factors affecting blood transfusion safety. The distribution of ABO and RhD blood groups varies globally, but limited data exist for ethnic distributions of these blood groups in Asian populations. We aimed to evaluate the distribution of ABO and RhD blood groups among Chinese ethnic groups.
METHODS:
A population-based cross-sectional study.
METHODS:
Data on ABO groups and ethnicities were obtained from the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project (NFPHEP) with participants from 220 counties of 31 provinces in China PARTICIPANTS: There were 3 832 034 participants aged 21-49 years who took part in the NFPHEP from January 2010 to December 2012 and were included in this study.
METHODS:
The proportion of ABO and RhD blood groups among different ethnic groups was calculated.
RESULTS:
ABO and RhD blood distribution was significantly different among nine ethnic groups (P<0.001). Compared with other ethnic groups, the Yi group had more A phenotypes (34.0%), and the Manchu (33.7%) and Mongolian (33.3%) ethnic groups had more B phenotypes. The Zhuang group had the greatest proportion of O phenotypes (41.8%), followed by the Miao group (37.7%). AB phenotypes were more frequent in the Uygur ethnic group (10.6%) but lower in the Zhuang group (5.5%). Meanwhile, RhD negativity (RhD-) was greater in the Uygur group (3.3%) than in the Mongolian (0.3%) and Manchu ethnic groups (0.4%). O RhD- blood groups were more frequent in the Uygur group (0.8%) than in the other ethnic groups (0.1%-0.4%, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS:
ABO and RhD blood phenotypes vary across different ethnic groups in China. The diversity in the distribution of the ABO and RhD blood groups in different ethnic groups should be considered when developing rational and evidence-based strategies for blood collection and management.

The adzuki bean weevil, Callosobruchus chinensis L., is one of the most destructive pests of stored legume seeds such as mungbean, cowpea, and adzuki bean, which usually cause considerable loss in the quantity and quality of stored seeds during transportation and storage. However, a lack of genetic information of this pest results in a series of genetic questions remain largely unknown, including population genetic structure, kinship, biotype abundance, and so on. Co-dominant microsatellite markers offer a great resolving power to determine these events. Here, we report rapid microsatellite isolation from C. chinensis via high-throughput sequencing.
RESULTS:
In this study, 94,560,852 quality-filtered and trimmed reads were obtained for the assembly of genome using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. In total, the genome with total length of 497,124,785 bp, comprising 403,113 high quality contigs was generated with de novo assembly. More than 6800 SSR loci were detected and a suit of 6303 primer pair sequences were designed and 500 of them were randomly selected for validation. Of these, 196 pair of primers, i.e. 39.2%, produced reproducible amplicons that were polymorphic among 8 C. chinensis genotypes collected from different geographical regions. Twenty out of 196 polymorphic SSR markers were used to analyze the genetic diversity of 18 C. chinensis populations. The results showed the twenty SSR loci were highly polymorphic among these populations.
CONCLUSIONS:
This study presents a first report of genome sequencing and de novo assembly for C. chinensis and demonstrates the feasibility of generating a large scale of sequence information and SSR loci isolation by Illumina paired-end sequencing. Our results provide a valuable resource for C. chinensis research. These novel markers are valuable for future genetic mapping, trait association, genetic structure and kinship among C. chinensis.

21150899,2010,"Medulloblastoma encompasses a collection of clinically and molecularly diverse tumour subtypes that together comprise the most common malignant childhood brain tumour. These tumours are thought to arise within the cerebellum, with approximately 25% originating from granule neuron precursor cells (GNPCs) after aberrant activation of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (hereafter, SHH subtype). The pathological processes that drive heterogeneity among the other medulloblastoma subtypes are not known, hindering the development of much needed new therapies. Here we provide evidence that a discrete subtype of medulloblastoma that contains activating mutations in the WNT pathway effector CTNNB1 (hereafter, WNT subtype) arises outside the cerebellum from cells of the dorsal brainstem. We found that genes marking human WNT-subtype medulloblastomas are more frequently expressed in the lower rhombic lip (LRL) and embryonic dorsal brainstem than in the upper rhombic lip (URL) and developing cerebellum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intra-operative reports showed that human WNT-subtype tumours infiltrate the dorsal brainstem, whereas SHH-subtype tumours are located within the cerebellar hemispheres. Activating mutations in Ctnnb1 had little impact on progenitor cell populations in the cerebellum, but caused the abnormal accumulation of cells on the embryonic dorsal brainstem which included aberrantly proliferating Zic1(+) precursor cells. These lesions persisted in all mutant adult mice; moreover, in 15% of cases in which Tp53 was concurrently deleted, they progressed to form medulloblastomas that recapitulated the anatomy and gene expression profiles of human WNT-subtype medulloblastoma. We provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that subtypes of medulloblastoma have distinct cellular origins. Our data provide an explanation for the marked molecular and clinical differences between SHH- and WNT-subtype medulloblastomas and have profound implications for future research and treatment of this important childhood cancer.",1,1,4,0,0
19348735,2009,"Recognizing emotion from facial expressions draws on diverse psychological processes implemented in a large array of neural structures. Two major theories of cerebral lateralization of emotional perception have been proposed: (i) the Right-Hemisphere Hypothesis (RHH) and (ii) the Valence-Specific Hypothesis (VSH). To test these lateralization models we conducted a large voxel-based meta-analysis of current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies employing emotional faces paradigms in healthy volunteers. Two independent researchers conducted separate comprehensive PUBMED (1990-May 2008) searches to find all functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using a variant of the emotional faces paradigm in healthy subjects. Out of the 551 originally identified studies, 105 studies met inclusion criteria. The overall database consisted of 1785 brain coordinates which yield an overall sample of 1600 healthy subjects. We found no support for the hypothesis of overall right-lateralization of emotional processing. Conversely, across all emotional conditions the parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, precuneus, inferior and middle occipital gyrus, posterior cingulated, middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal and superior frontal gyri were activated bilaterally (p=0.001). There was a valence-specific lateralization of brain response during negative emotions processing in the left amygdala (p=0.001).

18448515,2008,"Studies in model organisms have demonstrated that components of insulin and insulin-like signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of lifespan but the relevance of those findings to humans has remained obscure. Here we provide evidence suggesting that variants of the gene encoding insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) may be influencing human lifespan. We have employed a variety of models and diverse samples that reproducibly indicate the relative change in IDE genotype frequency across the age spectrum as well as allow the detection of association with age-at-death. A tenable molecular basis of this is suggested by the observation of genetic association with both fasting plasma insulin levels and IDE mRNA expression. Across populations the emergent genetic model is indicative of over-dominance, where heterozygotes of critical markers have increased IDE mRNA expression and insulin levels, and this is reflected in diminished heterozygosity at advanced age. A critical and replicating feature of this study is that change in IDE genotype frequency with advancing age appears to be occurring only in men, and this is supported in that insulin levels are only associated with IDE in men. Results suggest a relationship between a gene that is intimately involved in insulin metabolism and the determination of lifespan in humans, but over-dominance and gender specificity will be important parameters to consider clarifying the biological importance of these findings.",1,1,8,0,0
27299279,2016,"Although there are high survival rates for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, their outcome is often counterbalanced by the burden of toxic effects. This is because reported frequencies vary widely across studies, partly because of diverse definitions of toxic effects. Using the Delphi method, 15 international childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia study groups assessed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocols to address toxic effects that were to be considered by the Ponte di Legno working group. 14 acute toxic effects (hypersensitivity to asparaginase, hyperlipidaemia, osteonecrosis, asparaginase-associated pancreatitis, arterial hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, seizures, depressed level of consciousness, methotrexate-related stroke-like syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, high-dose methotrexate-related nephrotoxicity, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, thromboembolism, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) that are serious but too rare to be addressed comprehensively within any single group, or are deemed to need consensus definitions for reliable incidence comparisons, were selected for assessment. Our results showed that none of the protocols addressed all 14 toxic effects, that no two protocols shared identical definitions of all toxic effects, and that no toxic effect definition was shared by all protocols. Using the Delphi method over three face-to-face plenary meetings, consensus definitions were obtained for all 14 toxic effects. In the overall assessment of outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment, these expert opinion-based definitions will allow reliable comparisons of frequencies and severities of acute toxic effects across treatment protocols, and facilitate international research on cause, guidelines for treatment adaptation, preventive strategies, and development of consensus algorithms for reporting on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment.",1,1,3,0,0
32316937,2020,"BACKGROUND:
Household chaos, represented by the level of disorganisation or environmental confusion in the home, has been associated with a range of adverse child and family outcomes. This review aims to (1) identify how household chaos is measured, (2) chart study details of household chaos literature, and (3) map the existing literature with respect to the relationship between household chaos and child, parent, and family outcomes. We expect that this review will highlight the need to consider the importance of household chaos in child well-being research, particularly in those families where children may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of household chaos.
METHODS:
We searched five electronic databases (last updated September 1st 2018) in addition to Google Scholar, and identified publications via a 3-stage screening process, which was conducted by two researchers. Published studies were included if they investigated the association between household chaos and child, parent, or family outcomes. Research that investigated household chaos as a mediator or moderator, or that investigated how the relationship between household chaos and the outcome of interest was mediated or moderated, were also included.
RESULTS:
One hundred twelve studies in 111 publications were included. The majority were conducted in the United States (n = 71), and used either cross-sectional (n = 60) or longitudinal (n = 49) study designs. Outcomes of interest were categorised into seven categories: (1) cognitive and academic (n = 16), (2) socio-emotional and behavioural (n = 60), (3) communication (n = 6), (4) parenting, family, and household functioning (n = 21), (5) parent outcomes (n = 6), (6) hormone (n = 8), and (7) physical health and health behaviours (n = 19). There was consistent evidence for significant correlations between household chaos and adverse outcomes across all seven categories in diverse populations with respect to age, disease status, and socio-economic status (SES).
CONCLUSIONS:
There is consistent evidence for associations between household chaos and a number of adverse child, parent, and family-level outcomes. Household chaos may also help describe variations in outcomes between low SES and child development.

CdLS individuals display diverse and variable deficits in growth, mental development, limbs, and organs. In the past few years it has been shown that CdLS is caused by gene mutations affecting proteins involved in sister chromatid cohesion. Studies in model organisms, and more recently in human cells, have revealed, somewhat unexpectedly, that the developmental deficits in CdLS likely arise from changes in gene expression. The mechanisms by which cohesion factors regulate gene expression remain to be elucidated, but current data suggest that they likely regulate transcription in multiple ways.",1,0,1,0,0
31206020,2019,"The wiring of vertebrate and invertebrate brains provides the anatomical skeleton for cognition and behavior. Connections among brain regions are characterized by heterogeneous strength that is parsimoniously described by the wiring cost and homophily principles. Moreover, brains exhibit a characteristic global network topology, including modules and hubs. However, the mechanisms resulting in the observed interregional wiring principles and network topology of brains are unknown. Here, with the aid of computational modeling, we demonstrate that a mechanism based on heterochronous and spatially ordered neurodevelopmental gradients, without the involvement of activity-dependent plasticity or axonal guidance cues, can reconstruct a large part of the wiring principles (on average, 83%) and global network topology (on average, 80%) of diverse adult brain connectomes, including fly and human connectomes.

25470780,2014,"Numerous studies suggest that the transition from Australopithecus to Homo was characterized by evolutionary innovation, resulting in the emergence and coexistence of a diversity of forms. However, the evolutionary processes necessary to drive such a transition have not been examined. Here, we apply statistical tests developed from quantitative evolutionary theory to assess whether morphological differences among late australopith and early Homo species in Africa have been shaped by natural selection. Where selection is demonstrated, we identify aspects of morphology that were most likely under selective pressure, and determine the nature (type, rate) of that selection. Results demonstrate that selection must be invoked to explain an Au. africanus-Au. sediba-Homo transition, while transitions from late australopiths to various early Homo species that exclude Au. sediba can be achieved through drift alone. Rate tests indicate that selection is largely directional, acting to rapidly differentiate these taxa. Reconstructions of patterns of directional selection needed to drive the Au. africanus-Au. sediba-Homo transition suggest that selection would have affected all regions of the skull. These results may indicate that an evolutionary path to Homo without Au. sediba is the simpler path and/or provide evidence that this pathway involved more reliance on cultural adaptations to cope with environmental change.

24302503,2013,"OBJECTIVE:
To determine a practical approach for deriving life expectancy estimates in Australian New South Wales local government areas which display a large diversity in population sizes.
METHODS:
Population-based study utilising mortality and estimated residential population data.
METHODS:
153 local government areas in New South Wales, Australia.
METHODS:
Key performance measures of Chiang II, Silcocks, adjusted Chiang II and Bayesian random effects model methodologies of life expectancy estimation including agreement analysis of life expectancy estimates and comparison of estimate SEs.
RESULTS:
Chiang II and Silcocks methods produced almost identical life expectancy estimates across a large range of population sizes but calculation failures and excessively large SEs limited their use in small populations. A population of 25 000 or greater was required to estimate life expectancy with SE of 1 year or less using adjusted Chiang II (a composite of Chiang II and Silcocks methods). Data aggregation offered some remedy for extending the use of adjusted Chiang II in small populations but reduced estimate currency. A recently developed Bayesian random effects model utilising the correlation in mortality rates between genders, age groups and geographical areas markedly improved the precision of life expectancy estimates in small populations.
CONCLUSIONS:
We propose a hybrid approach for the calculation of life expectancy using the Bayesian random effects model in populations of 25 000 or lower permitting the precise derivation of life expectancy in small populations. In populations above 25 000, we propose the use of adjusted Chiang II to guard against violations of spatial correlation, to benefit from a widely accepted method that is simpler to communicate to local health authorities and where its slight inferior performance compared with the Bayesian approach is of minor practical significance.

31474318,2019,"Cerebellar malformations are diverse congenital anomalies frequently associated with developmental disability. Although genetic and prenatal non-genetic causes have been described, no systematic analysis has been performed. Here, we present a large-exome sequencing study of Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) and cerebellar hypoplasia (CBLH). We performed exome sequencing in 282 individuals from 100 families with DWM or CBLH, and we established a molecular diagnosis in 36 of 100 families, with a significantly higher yield for CBLH (51%) than for DWM (16%). The 41 variants impact 27 neurodevelopmental-disorder-associated genes, thus demonstrating that CBLH and DWM are often features of monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders. Though only seven monogenic causes (19%) were identified in more than one individual, neuroimaging review of 131 additional individuals confirmed cerebellar abnormalities in 23 of 27 genetic disorders (85%). Prenatal risk factors were frequently found among individuals without a genetic diagnosis (30 of 64 individuals [47%]). Single-cell RNA sequencing of prenatal human cerebellar tissue revealed gene enrichment in neuronal and vascular cell types; this suggests that defective vasculogenesis may disrupt cerebellar development. Further, de novo gain-of-function variants in PDGFRB, a tyrosine kinase receptor essential for vascular progenitor signaling, were associated with CBLH, and this discovery links genetic and non-genetic etiologies. Our results suggest that genetic defects impact specific cerebellar cell types and implicate abnormal vascular development as a mechanism for cerebellar malformations. We also confirmed a major contribution for non-genetic prenatal factors in individuals with cerebellar abnormalities, substantially influencing diagnostic evaluation and counseling regarding recurrence risk and prognosis.",1,1,2,0,0

We assessed nucleotide sequence variability in the 5' noncoding region of hepatitis C virus, using restriction enzymes to analyze the distribution of hepatitis C virus genotypes, in 80 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Genotypes were correlated with demographic, clinical and histological features. Thirty-seven patients were infected with type 1, 10 had type 2 and 8 had type 3, and another 23 were infected with a new distinct hepatitis C virus type now classified as type 4. Two were infected with variants whose classification are uncertain. Types 1, 2 and 3 were found in patients from the United Kingdom, southern Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. Nineteen of 23 type 4 genotype isolates were from Middle Eastern patients, compared with 0 of 37 type 1 isolates (p < 0.001). Of 21 Middle Eastern patients, 19 (90.4%) had type 4 hepatitis C virus (p = 0.001, odds ratio = 9).

28654654,2017,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea, has a number of factors known to contribute to pathogenesis; however, a full understanding of these processes and their regulation has proven to be elusive. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of bacterial proteins are now recognized as one mechanism of protein regulation. In the present study, Western blot analyses, with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody, indicated that a large number of gonococcal proteins are post-translationally modified. Previous work has shown that Nε-lysine acetylation can occur non-enzymatically with acetyl-phosphate (AcP) as the acetyl donor. In the current study, an acetate kinase mutant (1291ackA), which accumulates AcP, was generated in N. gonorrhoeae. Broth cultures of N. gonorrhoeae 1291wt and 1291ackA were grown, proteins extracted and digested, and peptides containing acetylated-lysines (K-acetyl) were affinity-enriched from both strains. Mass spectrometric analyses of these samples identified a total of 2686 unique acetylation sites. Label-free relative quantitation of the K-acetyl peptides derived from the ackA and wild-type (wt) strains demonstrated that 109 acetylation sites had an ackA/wt ratio>2 and p-values <0.05 in at least 2/3 of the biological replicates and were designated as ""AckA-dependent"". Regulated K-acetyl sites were found in ribosomal proteins, central metabolism proteins, iron acquisition and regulation proteins, pilus assembly and regulation proteins, and a two-component response regulator. Since AckA is part of a metabolic pathway, comparative growth studies of the ackA mutant and wt strains were performed. The mutant showed a growth defect under aerobic conditions, an inability to grow anaerobically, and a defect in biofilm maturation. In conclusion, the current study identified AckA-dependent acetylation sites in N. gonorrhoeae and determined that these sites are found in a diverse group of proteins.

Overexpression of Dp110 in wing or eye imaginal discs resulted in flies with enlarged wings or eyes respectively. In contrast, overexpression of Dp110 containing a mutation predicted to result in the loss of catalytic activity resulted in smaller wings and eyes. The alterations in wing size result from changes in both cell size and cell number, whereas in the eye only differences in cell size were detected.

Identifying key regulators in diverse transduction pathways that define VSV oncolysis in cancer cells represents a fundamental prerequisite to engineering more effective oncolytic viral vectors and adjusting combination therapies. After having identified defects in the signalling cascade of type I interferon induction, responsible for attenuated antiviral responses in human HCC cell lines, we have now investigated the role of cell proliferation and translation initiation. Cell cycle progression and translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF2Bepsilon have been recently identified as key regulators of VSV permissiveness in T-lymphocytes and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts, respectively. Here, we show that in HCC, decrease of cell proliferation by cell cycle inhibitors or siRNA-mediated reduction of G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase activities (CDK4) or cyclin D1 protein expression, do not significantly alter viral growth. Additionally, we demonstrate that translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF2Bepsilon are negligible in sustaining VSV replication in HCC. Taken together, these results indicate that cellular proliferation and the initiation phase of cellular protein synthesis are not essential for successful VSV oncolysis of HCC. Moreover, our observations indicate the importance of cell-type specificity for VSV oncolysis, an important aspect to be considered in virotherapy applications in the future.",1,0,1,0,0

PS-CFP is capable of efficient photoconversion from cyan to green, changing both its excitation and emission spectra in response to 405-nm light irradiation. Complete photoactivation of PS-CFP results in a 1,500-fold increase in the green-to-cyan fluorescence ratio, making it the highest-contrast monomeric photoactivatable fluorescent protein described to date.

17947681,2007,"Human mast cell tryptases vary strikingly in secretion, catalytic competence, and inheritance. To explore the basis of variation, we compared genes from a range of primates, including humans, great apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan), Old- and New-World monkeys (macaque and marmoset), and a prosimian (galago), tracking key changes. Our analysis reveals that extant soluble tryptase-like proteins, including alpha- and beta-like tryptases, mastins, and implantation serine proteases, likely evolved from membrane-anchored ancestors because their more deeply rooted relatives (gamma tryptases, pancreasins, prostasins) are type I transmembrane peptidases. Function-altering mutations appeared at widely separated times during primate speciation, with tryptases evolving by duplication, gene conversion, and point mutation. The alpha-tryptase Gly(216)Asp catalytic domain mutation, which diminishes activity, is present in macaque tryptases, and thus arose before great apes and Old World monkeys shared an ancestor, and before the alphabeta split. However, the Arg(-3)Gln processing mutation appeared recently, affecting only human alpha. By comparison, the transmembrane gamma-tryptase gene, which anchors the telomeric end of the multigene tryptase locus, changed little during primate evolution. Related transmembrane peptidase genes were found in reptiles, amphibians, and fish. We identified soluble tryptase-like genes in the full spectrum of mammals, including marsupial (opossum) and monotreme (platypus), but not in nonmammalian vertebrates. Overall, our analysis suggests that soluble tryptases evolved rapidly from membrane-anchored, two-chain peptidases in ancestral vertebrates into soluble, single-chain, self-compartmentalizing, inhibitor-resistant oligomers expressed primarily by mast cells, and that much of present numerical, behavioral, and genetic diversity of alpha- and beta-like tryptases was acquired during primate evolution.",1,1,3,0,0
22073264,2011,"Increasing anthropogenic pressures urge enhanced knowledge and understanding of the current state of marine biodiversity. This baseline information is pivotal to explore present trends, detect future modifications and propose adequate management actions for marine ecosystems. Coralligenous outcrops are a highly diverse and structurally complex deep-water habitat faced with major threats in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite its ecological, aesthetic and economic value, coralligenous biodiversity patterns are still poorly understood. There is currently no single sampling method that has been demonstrated to be sufficiently representative to ensure adequate community assessment and monitoring in this habitat. Therefore, we propose a rapid non-destructive protocol for biodiversity assessment and monitoring of coralligenous outcrops providing good estimates of its structure and species composition, based on photographic sampling and the determination of presence/absence of macrobenthic species. We used an extensive photographic survey, covering several spatial scales (100s of m to 100s of km) within the NW Mediterranean and including 2 different coralligenous assemblages: Paramuricea clavata (PCA) and Corallium rubrum assemblage (CRA). This approach allowed us to determine the minimal sampling area for each assemblage (5000 cm(2) for PCA and 2500 cm(2) for CRA). In addition, we conclude that 3 replicates provide an optimal sampling effort in order to maximize the species number and to assess the main biodiversity patterns of studied assemblages in variability studies requiring replicates. We contend that the proposed sampling approach provides a valuable tool for management and conservation planning, monitoring and research programs focused on coralligenous outcrops, potentially also applicable in other benthic ecosystems.",1,0,1,0,2

Ninety-nine isolates with tetracycline MICs >32 mg/L were characterized by auxotype/serovar (A/S) class, plasmid profile, hybridization with eight tetracycline-resistant probes, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of genomic DNA after digestion with NheI and SpeI restriction endonucleases. A cluster of 82 isolates with penicillin MICs of 2-4 mg/L and tetracycline MICs of 128 mg/L (chromosomally mediated resistance) belonged to A/S class NR/IB-1 and had identical or closely related PFGE profiles. Seventeen isolates, TRNG (10) and penicillinase-producing TRNG (7), with tetracycline MICs of 64-256 mg/L, belonged to eight A/S classes and displayed 12 different PFGE profiles.

27934910,2016,"Rickettsiales are important zoonotic pathogens, causing severe disease in humans globally. Although mosquitoes are an important vector for diverse pathogens, with the exception of members of the genus Wolbachia little is known about their role in the transmission of Rickettsiales. Herein, Rickettsiales were identified by PCR in five species of mosquitoes (Anopheles sinensis, Armigeres subalbatus, Aedes albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus and Cu. tritaeniorhynchus) collected from three Chinese provinces during 2014-2015. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses of the rrs, groEL and gltA genes revealed the presence of Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Candidatus Neoehrlichia, and Rickettsia bacteria in mosquitoes, comprising nine documented and five tentative species bacteria, as well as three symbionts/endosybionts. In addition, bacteria were identified in mosquito eggs, larvae, and pupae sampled from aquatic environments. Hence, these data suggest that Rickettsiales circulate widely in mosquitoes in nature. Also of note was that Ehrlichia and Rickettsia bacteria were detected in each life stage of laboratory cultured mosquitoes, suggesting that Rickettsiales may be maintained in mosquitoes through both transstadial and transovarial transmission. In sum, these data indicate that mosquitoes may have played an important role in the transmission and evolution of Rickettsiales in nature.",1,0,1,0,1
31932738,2020,"Traditionally viewed as an autodigestive pathway, autophagy also facilitates cellular secretion; however, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that components of the autophagy machinery specify secretion within extracellular vesicles (EVs). Using a proximity-dependent biotinylation proteomics strategy, we identify 200 putative targets of LC3-dependent secretion. This secretome consists of a highly interconnected network enriched in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and EV cargoes. Proteomic and RNA profiling of EVs identifies diverse RBPs and small non-coding RNAs requiring the LC3-conjugation machinery for packaging and secretion. Focusing on two RBPs, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK) and scaffold-attachment factor B (SAFB), we demonstrate that these proteins interact with LC3 and are secreted within EVs enriched with lipidated LC3. Furthermore, their secretion requires the LC3-conjugation machinery, neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) and LC3-dependent recruitment of factor associated with nSMase2 activity (FAN). Hence, the LC3-conjugation pathway controls EV cargo loading and secretion.",1,0,1,0,0

Little is known about the level and pattern of genetic polymorphism in homeobox genes. We have analyzed nucleotide polymorphism in 27 strains of Drosophila melanogaster and one each of D. simulans and D. sechellia, within two closely linked regions encompassing a partial sequence of tin and the complete sequence of bap. The two genes exhibit different levels and patterns of nucleotide diversity. Two sets of sharply divergent sequence types are detected for tin. The haplotype structure of bap is more complex: about half of the sequences are identical (or virtually so), while the rest are fairly heterogeneous. The level of silent nucleotide variability is 0.0063 for tin but significantly higher, 0.0141, for bap, a level of polymorphism comparable to the most polymorphic structural genes of D. melanogaster. Recombination rate and gene conversion are also higher for bap than for tin. There is strong linkage disequilibrium, with the highest values in the introns of both genes and exon II of bap. The patterns of polymorphism in tin and bap are not compatible with an equilibrium model of selective neutrality. We suggest that negative selection and demographic history are the major factors shaping the pattern of nucleotide polymorphism in the tin and bap genes; moreover, there are clear indications of positive selection in the bap gene.",1,0,1,0,0
28893212,2017,"BACKGROUND:
Although vaccinations are critical for preventing emerging infectious diseases, scant research has been conducted on risk communication. With socio-economic characteristics, health behavior, and underlying diseases under control, we investigated associations between media use, health information-seeking behavior, health information type, and vaccination in the population.
METHODS:
This study relied on a national survey of Korean adults (n = 1367). Participants were adult males and females age 20 and older. Web and face-to-face surveys were conducted throughout July 2014. The main outcome was vaccination (categorized as yes or no). Independent variables were time spent on media, frequency of health information-seeking behavior, and types of health information sought.
RESULTS:
Controlling for co-variates, logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that influence Korean adults being vaccinated. Results revealed that accessible information about emerging infectious diseases, listening to the radio, and reading the newspaper were associated with increased odds of being vaccinated. Active seeking health information as well as being female and of higher socio-economic status were positively correlated with Korean adults being vaccinated.
CONCLUSION:
It is critical to promote health information-seeking behavior and use diverse media channels to increase acceptance and awareness of emerging infectious diseases and vaccinations. Because there are differences in vaccination awareness depending on social class, it is critical to reduce communication inequality, strengthen accessibility to vaccinations, and devise appropriate risk communication strategies that ensure Korean adults receive vaccinations.

This plasmid confers reduced susceptibility to tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole. The complete sequence of plasmid pDTC28 was 61,503 bp in length with an average G+C content of 64.09%. Plasmid pDTC28 belongs to the IncP-1β group by phylogenetic analysis. The backbones of plasmid pDTC28 and other IncP-1β plasmids are very classical and conserved, whereas the accessory regions of these plasmids are diverse. A blaGES-5-like gene was found on the accessory region, and this blaGES-5-like gene contained 18 silent mutations and 7 missense mutations compared with the blaGES-5 gene. The mutations resulted in 7 amino acid substitutions in GES-5 carbapenemase, causing the loss of function of the blaGES-5-like gene on plasmid pDTC28 against carbapenems and even β-lactams. The enzyme produced by the blaGES-5-like gene cassette may be a new variant of GES-type enzymes. Thus, the plasmid sequenced in this study will expand our understanding of GES-type β-lactamases and provide insights into the genetic platforms used for the dissemination of GES-type genes.",1,0,1,0,0

Although our understanding of this area remains incomplete, certain inflammatory pathways have emerged as important mediators of the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammation in tumors. Consistent with the multifaceted roles for autophagy in tumor cells, results to date support the hypothesis that inflammatory pathways can suppress or induce autophagy in a context-dependent manner; in turn, autophagy suppresses or promotes inflammation in cancers.

30796141,2019,"Physicians in most specialties frequently encounter patients with neurologic conditions. For most non-neurologists, postgraduate neurologic education is variable and often limited, so every medical school's curriculum must include clinical learning experiences to ensure that all graduating medical students have the basic knowledge and skills required to care for patients with common neurologic symptoms and neurologic emergencies. In the nearly 20 years that have elapsed since the development of the initial American Academy of Neurology (AAN)-endorsed core curriculum for neurology clerkships, many medical school curricula have evolved to include self-directed learning, shortened foundational coursework, earlier clinical experiences, and increased utilization of longitudinal clerkships. A workgroup of both the Undergraduate Education Subcommittee and Consortium of Neurology Clerkship Directors of the AAN was formed to update the prior curriculum to ensure that the content is current and the format is consistent with evolving medical school curricula. The updated curriculum document replaces the term clerkship with experience, to allow for its use in nontraditional curricular structures. Other changes include a more streamlined list of symptom complexes, provision of a list of recommended clinical encounters, and incorporation of midrotation feedback. The hope is that these additions will provide a helpful resource to curriculum leaders in meeting national accreditation standards.

We measured the prevalence of rotavirus infection in primary care clinics in León, Nicaragua, after introduction of the immunization program. In the post-vaccine period, 3.5% (95% confidence interval = 1.9-5.8) of children seeking care for diarrhea tested positive for rotavirus.

33033407,2020,"Therapeutic resistance continues to be an indominable foe in our ambition for curative cancer treatment. Recent insights into the molecular determinants of acquired treatment resistance in the clinical and experimental setting have challenged the widely held view of sequential genetic evolution as the primary cause of resistance and brought into sharp focus a range of non-genetic adaptive mechanisms. Notably, the genetic landscape of the tumour and the non-genetic mechanisms used to escape therapy are frequently linked. Remarkably, whereas some oncogenic mutations allow the cancer cells to rapidly adapt their transcriptional and/or metabolic programme to meet and survive the therapeutic pressure, other oncogenic drivers convey an inherent cellular plasticity to the cancer cell enabling lineage switching and/or the evasion of anticancer immunosurveillance. The prevalence and diverse array of non-genetic resistance mechanisms pose a new challenge to the field that requires innovative strategies to monitor and counteract these adaptive processes. In this Perspective we discuss the key principles of non-genetic therapy resistance in cancer.

The development of new genomic tools, including next generation sequencing and CNV assays, provides opportunities to characterize the genetic variations of this system. The advent of large-scale functional screens of expressed ORs, combined with genetic association studies, has the potential to link variations in ORs to human chemosensory phenotypes.

We use Internet query data and citizen science data to characterize public interest in 621 bird species across the United States. We estimate the relative popularity of different birds by quantifying how frequently people use Google to search for species, relative to the rates at which they are encountered in the environment. In intraspecific analyses, we also quantify the degree to which Google searches are limited to, or extend beyond, the places in which people encounter each species. The resulting metrics of popularity and geographic specificity of interest allow us to define aspects of relationships between people and birds within a cultural niche space. We then estimate the influence of species traits and socially constructed labels on niche positions to assess the importance of observations and ideas in shaping public interest in birds. Our analyses show clear effects of migratory strategy, color, degree of association with bird feeders, and, especially, body size on niche position.

33051304,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease that has spread worldwide. In the United States, COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, with an observed 2-fold higher rate for hospitalization and greater than 2-fold higher rate for death as compared with White Americans. The disparity seen with COVID-19 is consistent with patterns of disparities observed for cancer; it is well documented that 5-year survival rates for multiple cancers are lower in African Americans compared with White Americans. Root cause contributions for the disparity overlap between COVID-19 and cancer. While cancer is a genetic disease that is influenced by tissue microenvironment, COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is enabled by cellular expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors. However, socioeconomic disadvantages, level of education, lifestyle factors, health comorbidities, and limited access to medical care appear to fuel underlying risk for both cancer and COVID-19 disparities. In addition to African Americans demonstrating higher risk of acquiring and dying from either disease, they are underrepresented in clinical trials involving cancer or COVID-19. Long-term disparities are present with survivorship from cancer and may be likely with survivorship from COVID-19; both have revealed untoward effects on postdiagnosis economic viability for African Americans. Collaborative strategies that include community engagement, diverse participation in cancer and COVID-19 clinical trials, providing insurance for affected persons who lost employment due to either disease, and supporting safety-net and public hospitals for health care access will be critical to stem these disparities.",1,1,12,8,8

In response to increased global public health funding initiatives to HIV/AIDS care in Africa, this study aimed to describe practice models, strategies and challenges to delivering end-of-life care in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS:
A survey end-of-life care programs was conducted, addressing the domains of service aims and configuration, barriers to pain control, governmental endorsement and strategies, funding, monitoring and evaluation, and research. Both closed and qualitative responses were sought.
RESULTS:
Despite great structural challenges, data from 48 programs in 14 countries with a mean annual funding of US 374,884 dollars demonstrated integrated care delivery across diverse settings. Care was commonly integrated with all advanced disease care (67%) and disease stages (65% offering care from diagnosis). The majority (98%) provided home-based care for a mean of 301 patients. Ninety-four percent reported challenges in pain control (including availability, lack of trained providers, stigma and legal restrictions), and 77% addressed the effects of poverty on disease progression and management. Although 85% of programs reported Government endorsement, end-of-life and palliative care National strategies were largely absent.
CONCLUSIONS:
The interdependent tasks of expanding pain control, balancing quality and coverage of care, providing technical assistance in monitoring and evaluation, collaborating between donor agencies and governments, and educating policy makers and program directors of end-of-life care are all necessary if resources are to reach their goals.

8354827,1993,"OBJECTIVE:
The objectives of this study were to determine the anatomic and physiological factors most responsible for the severe symptoms and poor prognosis of infants with scimitar syndrome.
BACKGROUND:
Whereas the diagnosis of scimitar syndrome is often made incidentally in older children and adults who undergo chest radiography for diverse reasons, infants in whom the diagnosis is made typically present with severe symptoms and have a poor prognosis.
METHODS:
The clinical, catheterization and imaging data of 13 consecutive infants with scimitar syndrome who underwent cardiac catheterization in the 1st 6 months of life were reviewed, with emphasis on the pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary and cardiovascular anatomy, therapeutic interventions and outcome.
RESULTS:
Twelve of the 13 infants had pulmonary hypertension at the time of diagnosis. Six patients died despite specific treatment. Eleven of 13 infants had associated cardiac malformations and 9 had large systemic arterial collateral channels to the right lung. Seven patients had anomalies involving the left side of the heart, especially varying degrees of hypoplasia of the left heart or aorta, and six of these patients died. Ten patients underwent surgical or transcatheter therapy in the 1st year of life. Systemic arteries to the right lung were ligated in three patients and occluded by transcatheter embolization in four. Balloon angioplasty was carried out in two patients, one with stenosis of the left-sided pulmonary veins and one with stenosis of the anomalous right pulmonary vein. The latter had placement of a balloon-expandable stent. In both patients, pulmonary vein stenosis progressed. Six patients had surgical repair of associated cardiovascular anomalies, and two required repair of extracardiac congenital anomalies. Occlusion of the anomalous systemic arteries was generally associated with clinical improvement, but congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension recurred in those patients with associated cardiovascular anomalies, whose condition subsequently responded after correction of the shunt lesions.
CONCLUSIONS:
The severe symptoms and pulmonary hypertension found in infants with scimitar syndrome have many causes. Anomalous systemic arterial supply, pulmonary vein stenosis and associated cardiovascular anomalies play a significant role, and the ultimate outcome of individual infants depends on the feasibility of treating these anomalies in early infancy.

20027309,2009,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) comprise a family of ligand-regulated transcription factors that control diverse critical biological processes including various aspects of brain development. Eighteen NR genes exist in the Drosophila genome. To explore their roles in brain development, we knocked down individual NRs through the development of the mushroom bodies (MBs) by targeted RNAi. Besides recapitulating the known MB phenotypes for three NRs, we found that unfulfilled (unf), an ortholog of human photoreceptor specific nuclear receptor (PNR), regulates axonal morphogenesis and neuronal subtype identity. The adult MBs develop through remodeling of gamma neurons plus de-novo elaboration of both alpha'/beta' and alpha/beta neurons. Notably, unf is largely dispensable for the initial elaboration of gamma neurons, but plays an essential role in their re-extension of axons after pruning during early metamorphosis. The subsequently derived MB neuron types also require unf for extension of axons beyond the terminus of the pruned bundle. Tracing single axons revealed misrouting rather than simple truncation. Further, silencing unf in single-cell clones elicited misguidance of axons in otherwise unperturbed MBs. Such axon guidance defects may occur as MB neurons partially lose their subtype identity, as evidenced by suppression of various MB subtype markers in unf knockdown MBs. In sum, unf governs axonal morphogenesis of multiple MB neuron types, possibly through regulating neuronal subtype identity.",1,1,2,0,0

18715682,2008,"After being victims of a serious iatrogenous damage, what kind of relationship can patients rebuild with the world of medicine? In this article, I examine this question in terms of the contaminated blood affair in France. Using a qualitative study of haemophiliac patients and their families as a base, I looked at the changes in their modes of commitment to medicine, from the period preceding contamination with AIDS through blood transfusion, until the present day. It would seem that the experience of iatrogenous injustice was at the root of a major reconfiguration: all of the patients looked back over their trajectories, examined their relationship with the medical world and changed their positions, but without necessarily drawing the same conclusions or taking the same stances. This article looks at the change from relationships essentially based on cooperation to relationships that are more negotiated. It also shows the current diversity in forms of commitment: they are the fruit of critical work, carried out by patients and their families, which reassesses both the cognitive and moral bases of medical legitimacy. The analysis of the reconfiguration of the relationships that haemophiliac patients have had with the medical world in the aftermath of the contaminated blood affair is enlightening in two ways. First of all, the current medical world would appear to be deeply marked by health scandals and the victims have become prime actors. Secondly, the experience of iatrogenicity asks, with especial acuteness, the question of confidence that is at the core of any clinical relationship. It thus has a heuristic value of general scope.",1,1,2,0,1
22685571,2012,"Mutation of the staphylococcal accessory regulator (sarA) limits biofilm formation in diverse strains of Staphylococcus aureus, but there are exceptions. One of these is the commonly studied strain Newman. This strain has two defects of potential relevance, the first being mutations that preclude anchoring of the fibronectin-binding proteins FnbA and FnbB to the cell wall, and the second being a point mutation in saeS that results in constitutive activation of the saePQRS regulatory system. We repaired these defects to determine whether either plays a role in biofilm formation and, if so, whether this could account for the reduced impact of sarA in Newman. Restoration of surface-anchored FnbA enhanced biofilm formation, but mutation of sarA in this fnbA-positive strain increased rather than decreased biofilm formation. Mutation of sarA in an saeS-repaired derivative of Newman (P18L) or a Newman saeRS mutant (ΔsaeRS) resulted in a biofilm-deficient phenotype like that observed in clinical isolates, even in the absence of surface-anchored FnbA. These phenotypes were correlated with increased production of extracellular proteases and decreased accumulation of FnbA and/or Spa in the P18L and ΔsaeRS sarA mutants by comparison to the Newman sarA mutant. The reduced accumulation of Spa was reversed by mutation of the gene encoding aureolysin, while the reduced accumulation of FnbA was reversed by mutation of the sspABC operon. These results demonstrate that saeRS and sarA act synergistically to repress the production of extracellular proteases that would otherwise limit accumulation of critical proteins that contribute to biofilm formation, with constitutive activation of saeRS limiting protease production, even in a sarA mutant, to a degree that can be correlated with increased enhanced capacity to form a biofilm.

27238024,2016,"Odor perception in mammals is mediated by parallel sensory pathways that convey distinct information about the olfactory world.

Sensory neurons of the ""necklace"" subsystem are nestled within the recesses of the olfactory epithelium and detect diverse odorants; however, they do not express known GPCR odor receptors. Here, we report that members of the four-pass transmembrane MS4A protein family are chemosensors expressed within necklace sensory neurons. These receptors localize to sensory endings and confer responses to ethologically relevant ligands, including pheromones and fatty acids, in vitro and in vivo. Individual necklace neurons co-express many MS4A proteins and are activated by multiple MS4A ligands; this pooling of information suggests that the necklace is organized more like subsystems for taste than for smell.

29255142,2017,"Whole cell responses arise from coordinated interactions between diverse human gene products functioning within various pathways underlying sub-cellular processes (SCP). Lower level SCPs interact to form higher level SCPs, often in a context specific manner to give rise to whole cell function. We sought to determine if capturing such relationships enables us to describe the emergence of whole cell functions from interacting SCPs. We developed the Molecular Biology of the Cell Ontology based on standard cell biology and biochemistry textbooks and review articles. Currently, our ontology contains 5,384 genes, 753 SCPs and 19,180 expertly curated gene-SCP associations. Our algorithm to populate the SCPs with genes enables extension of the ontology on demand and the adaption of the ontology to the continuously growing cell biological knowledge. Since whole cell responses most often arise from the coordinated activity of multiple SCPs, we developed a dynamic enrichment algorithm that flexibly predicts SCP-SCP relationships beyond the current taxonomy. This algorithm enables us to identify interactions between SCPs as a basis for higher order function in a context dependent manner, allowing us to provide a detailed description of how SCPs together can give rise to whole cell functions. We conclude that this ontology can, from omics data sets, enable the development of detailed SCP networks for predictive modeling of emergent whole cell functions.",1,0,1,0,0
15375023,2004,"The heart has a tremendous capacity for ATP generation, allowing it to function as an efficient pump throughout the life of the organism. The adult myocardium uses either fatty acid or glucose oxidation as its main energy source. Under normal conditions, the adult heart derives most of its energy through oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. However, the myocardium has a remarkable ability to switch between carbohydrate and fat fuel sources so that ATP production is maintained at a constant rate in diverse physiological and dietary conditions. This fuel selection flexibility is important for normal cardiac function. Although cardiac energy conversion capacity and metabolic flux is modulated at many levels, an important mechanism of regulation occurs at the level of gene expression. The expression of genes involved in multiple energy transduction pathways is dynamically regulated in response to developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological cues. This review is focused on gene transcription pathways involved in short- and long-term regulation of myocardial energy metabolism. Much of our knowledge about cardiac metabolic regulation comes from studies focused on mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The genes involved in this key energy metabolic pathway are transcriptionally regulated by members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, specifically the fatty acid-activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and the nuclear receptor coactivator, PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha). The dynamic regulation of the cardiac PPAR/PGC-1 complex in accordance with physiological and pathophysiological states will be described.",1,1,3,0,0
27178975,2016,"INTRODUCTION:
The variety of organisations providing National Health Service (NHS)-funded services in England is growing. Besides NHS hospitals and general practitioners (GPs), they include corporations, social enterprises, voluntary organisations and others. The degree to which these organisational types vary, however, in the ways they manage and provide services and in the outcomes for service quality, patient experience and innovation, remains unclear. This research will help those who commission NHS services select among the different types of organisation for different tasks.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
The main research questions are how organisationally diverse NHS-funded service providers vary in their responsiveness to patient choice, NHS commissioning and policy changes; and their patterns of innovation. We aim to assess the implications for NHS commissioning and managerial practice which follow from these differences.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS:
Systematic qualitative comparison across a purposive sample (c.12) of providers selected for maximum variety of organisational type, with qualitative studies of patient experience and choice (in the same sites). We focus is on NHS services heavily used by older people at high risk of hospital admission: community health services; out-of-hours primary care; and secondary care (planned orthopaedics or ophthalmology). The expected outputs will be evidence-based schemas showing how patterns of service development and delivery typically vary between different organisational types of provider.
ETHICS, BENEFITS AND DISSEMINATION:
We will ensure informants' organisational and individual anonymity when dealing with high profile case studies and a competitive health economy. The frail elderly is a key demographic sector with significant policy and financial implications. For NHS commissioners, patients, doctors and other stakeholders, the main outcome will be better knowledge about the relative merits of different kinds of healthcare provider. Dissemination will make use of strategies suggested by patient and public involvement, as well as DH and service-specific outlets.

23160379,2012,"Claudins (CLDNs) are a family of integral membrane proteins central to the formation of tight junctions, structures that are involved in paracellular transport and cellular growth and differentiation, and are critical for the maintenance of cellular polarity. Recent studies have provided evidence that CLDNs are aberrantly expressed in diverse types of human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). However, little is known about how CLDN expression is involved in cancer progression. In this study, we show that CLDN1 has a causal role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human liver cells, and that the c-Abl-Ras-Raf-1-ERK1/2 signaling axis is critical for the induction of malignant progression by CLDN1. Overexpression of CLDN1 induced expression of the EMT-regulating transcription factors Slug and Zeb1, and thereby led to repression of E-cadherin, β-catenin expression, enhanced expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin, a loss of cell adhesion, and increased cell motility in normal liver cells and HCC cells. In line with these findings, inhibition of either c-Abl or ERK clearly attenuated CLDN1-induced EMT, as evidenced by a reversal of N-cadherin and E-cadherin expression patterns, and restored normal motility. Collectively, these results indicate that CLDN1 is necessary for the induction of EMT in human liver cells, and that activation of the c-Abl-Ras-Raf-1-ERK1/2 signaling pathway is required for CLDN1-induced acquisition of the malignant phenotype. The present observations suggest that CLDN1 could be exploited as a biomarker for liver cancer metastasis and might provide a pivotal point for therapeutic intervention in HCC.",1,0,1,0,0

Here we sequence the genomes of 137 ancient humans (about 1× average coverage), covering a period of 4,000 years, to understand the population history of the Eurasian steppes after the Bronze Age migrations. We find that the genetics of the Scythian groups that dominated the Eurasian steppes throughout the Iron Age were highly structured, with diverse origins comprising Late Bronze Age herders, European farmers and southern Siberian hunter-gatherers. Later, Scythians admixed with the eastern steppe nomads who formed the Xiongnu confederations, and moved westward in about the second or third century BC, forming the Hun traditions in the fourth-fifth century AD, and carrying with them plague that was basal to the Justinian plague. These nomads were further admixed with East Asian groups during several short-term khanates in the Medieval period. These historical events transformed the Eurasian steppes from being inhabited by Indo-European speakers of largely West Eurasian ancestry to the mostly Turkic-speaking groups of the present day, who are primarily of East Asian ancestry.",1,1,5,2,16

23469278,2013,"The deterioration of alpine grassland has great impact on ecosystem services in the alpine region of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. However, the effect of grassland degradation on ecosystem services and the consequence of grassland deterioration on economic loss still remains a mystery. So, in this study, we assessed four types of ecosystem services following the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment classification, along a degradation gradient. Five sites of alpine grassland at different levels of degradation were investigated in Guoluo Prefecture of Qinghai Province, China. The species composition, aboveground biomass, soil total organic carbon (TOC), and soil total nitrogen (TN) were tested to evaluate major ecological services of the alpine grassland. We estimated the value of primary production, carbon storage, nitrogen recycling, and plant diversity. The results show the ecosystem services of alpine grassland varied along the degradation gradient. The ecosystem services of degraded grassland (moderate, heavy and severe) were all significantly lower than non-degraded grassland. Interestingly, the lightly degraded grassland provided more economic benefit from carbon maintenance and nutrient sequestration compared to non-degraded. Due to the destruction of the alpine grassland, the economic loss associated with decrease of biomass in 2008 was $198/ha. Until 2008, the economic loss caused by carbon emissions and nitrogen loss on severely degraded grassland was up to $8 033/ha and $13 315/ha, respectively. Urgent actions are required to maintain or promote the ecosystem services of alpine grassland in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.",1,0,1,0,10
31839128,2020,"BACKGROUND:
Describing the prevalence and trends of cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is crucial for monitoring progress, planning prevention, and providing evidence to support policy efforts. We aimed to analyse the transition in body-mass index (BMI), obesity, blood pressure, raised blood pressure, and diabetes in the Americas, between 1980 and 2014.
METHODS:
We did a pooled analysis of population-based studies with data on anthropometric measurements, biomarkers for diabetes, and blood pressure from adults aged 18 years or older. A Bayesian model was used to estimate trends in BMI, raised blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg), and diabetes (fasting plasma glucose ≥7·0 mmol/L, history of diabetes, or diabetes treatment) from 1980 to 2014, in 37 countries and six subregions of the Americas.
FINDINGS:
389 population-based surveys from the Americas were available. Comparing prevalence estimates from 2014 with those of 1980, in the non-English speaking Caribbean subregion, the prevalence of obesity increased from 3·9% (95% CI 2·2-6·3) in 1980, to 18·6% (14·3-23·3) in 2014, in men; and from 12·2% (8·2-17·0) in 1980, to 30·5% (25·7-35·5) in 2014, in women. The English-speaking Caribbean subregion had the largest increase in the prevalence of diabetes, from 5·2% (2·1-10·4) in men and 6·4% (2·6-10·4) in women in 1980, to 11·1% (6·4-17·3) in men and 13·6% (8·2-21·0) in women in 2014). Conversely, the prevalence of raised blood pressure has decreased in all subregions; the largest decrease was found in North America from 27·6% (22·3-33·2) in men and 19·9% (15·8-24·4) in women in 1980, to 15·5% (11·1-20·9) in men and 10·7% (7·7-14·5) in women in 2014.
INTERPRETATION:
Despite the generally high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors across the Americas, estimates also showed a high level of heterogeneity in the transition between countries. The increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes observed over time requires appropriate measures to deal with these public health challenges. Our results support a diversification of health interventions across subregions and countries.

22529960,2012,"BACKGROUND:
The dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in Crohn's disease (CD), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in Chinese subjects with CD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in Chinese CD patients using culture-independent techniques.
RESULTS:
Eighteen patients with CD and 9 healthy controls were included in this study. The faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with DNA sequencing and BLAST. We showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of CD patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). The faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of γ-Proteobacteria (especially Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in CD, including an increase in Escherichia coli, a decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Lactobacillus coleohominis, Bacteroides sp and Streptococcus gallolyticus in the bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS:
This is the first description of intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in Chinese CD patients. These results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in CD, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. The findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of CD in Chinese population.

Here it permits communication between axons and glial cells, enabling axon activity to couple with high fidelity to glial physiology.

Previous works have examined several electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters as potential predictors of CA success, such as fibrillatory wave (f-wave) amplitude. However, they require a manual computation and consider only a subset of electrodes, so inter-lead spatial variability of the 12-lead ECG is not fully exploited. The present study puts forward an automatic procedure for f-wave amplitude computation to non-invasively predict CA outcome. An extension of this quantitative measure to the whole set of leads is also proposed, based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

25659089,2015,"Scorpions belonging to the Buthidae family have traditionally drawn much of the biochemist's attention due to the strong toxicity of their venoms. Scorpions not toxic to mammals, however, also have complex venoms. They have been shown to be an important source of bioactive peptides, some of them identified as potential drug candidates for the treatment of several emerging diseases and conditions. It is therefore important to characterize the large diversity of components found in the non-Buthidae venoms. As a contribution to this goal, this manuscript reports the construction and characterization of cDNA libraries from four scorpion species belonging to the Vaejovis genus of the Vaejovidae family: Vaejovis mexicanus, V. intrepidus, V. subcristatus and V. punctatus. Some sequences coding for channel-acting toxins were found, as expected, but the main transcribed genes in the glands actively producing venom were those coding for non disulfide-bridged peptides. The ESTs coding for putative channel-acting toxins, corresponded to sodium channel β toxins, to members of the potassium channel-acting α or κ families, and to calcium channel-acting toxins of the calcin family. Transcripts for scorpine-like peptides of two different lengths were found, with some of the species coding for the two kinds. One sequence coding for La1-like peptides, of yet unknown function, was found for each species. Finally, the most abundant transcripts corresponded to peptides belonging to the long chain multifunctional NDBP-2 family and to the short antimicrobials of the NDBP-4 family. This apparent venom composition is in correspondence with the data obtained to date for other non-Buthidae species. Our study constitutes the first approach to the characterization of the venom gland transcriptome for scorpion species belonging to the Vaejovidae family. ",1,0,1,0,0

When dealing with fossil materials, all the above hypotheses are plausible, but a detailed taphonomical study has to be performed to rule out the possibility that secondary processes of recrystallization have occurred during fossilization. Traditional analyses, such as optical microscopy inspection and cathodoluminescence, have proven not to be enough to understand the taphonomic story of some eggshells. Recently, electron backscatter diffraction has been used, in combination with other techniques, to better understand the alteration of fossil eggshells. Here we present a combined study using scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, cathodoluminescence and electron backscatter diffraction of eggshell fragments assigned to Megaloolithus cf. siruguei from the Upper Cretaceous outcrops of the Cameros Basin. We focus our study on the presence of secondary shell units that mimic most aspects of the ultrastructure of the eggshell mammillae, but grow far from the inner surface of the eggshell. We call these structures extra-spherulites, describe their crystal structure and demonstrate their secondary origin. Our study has important implications for the interpretation of secondary shell units as biological or pathological structures. Thus, electron backscatter diffraction complements other microscope techniques as a useful tool for understanding taphonomical alterations in fossil eggshells.",1,1,2,0,0

9582078,1998,"Voltage-dependent, ion-selective channels such as Na+, Ca2+ and K+ channel proteins function as tetrameric assemblies of identical or similar subunits. The clustering of four subunits is thought to create an aqueous pore centred at the four-fold symmetry axis. The highly conserved, amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain (approximately 130 amino acids) immediately preceding the first putative transmembrane helix S1 is designated T1. It is known to confer specificity for tetramer formation, so the heteromeric assembly of K+-channel subunits is an important mechanism for the observed channel diversity. We have determined the crystal structure of the T1 domain of a Shaker potassium channel at 1.55 A resolution. The structure reveals that four identical subunits are arranged in a four-fold symmetry surrounding a centrally located pore about 20 A in length. Subfamily-specific assembly is provided primarily by polar interactions encoded in a conserved set of amino acids at its tetramerization interface. Most highly conserved amino acids in the T1 domain of all known potassium channels are found in the core of the protein, indicating a common structural framework for the tetramer assembly.",1,0,1,0,0

A relative risk of 2.06 (95% CI, 1.40-2.80; P < 0.001) among this epidemiologically complete population may constitute an estimate of risk for mortality inherent to schizophrenia when disengagement from health services, residential mobility and socioeconomic, ethnic and geographical diversity are minimised.

Cyanobacteria are equipped with efficient carbon fixation mechanism, and are ideal cell factories to produce various fuel and chemical products. Past efforts to produce terpenes in photosynthetic organisms have gained only limited success. Here we engineered the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to efficiently produce limonene through modeling guided study. Computational modeling of limonene flux in response to photosynthetic output has revealed the downstream terpene synthase as a key metabolic flux-controlling node in the MEP (2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate) pathway-derived terpene biosynthesis. By enhancing the downstream limonene carbon sink, we achieved over 100-fold increase in limonene productivity, in contrast to the marginal increase achieved through stepwise metabolic engineering. The establishment of a strong limonene flux revealed potential synergy between photosynthate output and terpene biosynthesis, leading to enhanced carbon flux into the MEP pathway. Moreover, we show that enhanced limonene flux would lead to NADPH accumulation, and slow down photosynthesis electron flow.

28253297,2017,"BACKGROUND:
There is emerging evidence linking diabetes with periodontal disease. Diabetes is a well-recognized risk factor for periodontal disease. Conversely, pro-inflammatory molecules released by periodontally-diseased tissues may enter the circulation to induce insulin resistance. While this association has been demonstrated in adults, there is little information regarding periodontal status in obese children with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). We hypothesized that children with T2D have higher rates of gingivitis, elevated salivary inflammatory markers, and an altered salivary microbiome compared to children without T2D.
METHODS:
Three pediatric cohorts ages 10-19 years were studied: lean (normal weight-C), obese (Ob), and obese with T2D (T2D). Each subject completed an oral health survey, received a clinical oral examination, and provided unstimulated saliva for measurement of inflammatory markers and microbiome analysis.
RESULTS:
The diabetes group was less likely to have had a dental visit within the last six months. Body mass index (BMI) Z-scores and waist circumference/height ratios were similar between Ob and T2D cohorts. The number of carious lesions and fillings were similar for all three groups. The gingival index was greater in the T2D group compared to the Ob and C groups. Although salivary microbial diversity was minimal between groups, a few differences in bacterial genus composition were noted.
CONCLUSIONS:
Obese children with T2D show a trend toward poorer oral health compared to normal weight and obese children without T2D. This study characterizes the salivary microbiome of children with and without obesity and T2D. This study supports a modest link between T2D and periodontal inflammation in the pediatric population.

To date, Multiplex PCR (MPCR) and 5'RACE are predominately used to enrich rearranged BCRs and TCRs. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages; however, a systematic evaluation and direct comparison of them would benefit researchers in the selection of the most suitable method. In this study, we used both pooled control plasmids and spiked-in cells to benchmark the MPCR bias. RNA from three healthy donors was subsequently processed with the two methods to perform a comparative evaluation of the TCR β chain sequences. Both approaches demonstrated high reproducibility (R2 = 0.9958 and 0.9878, respectively). No differences in gene usage were identified for most V/J genes (>60%), and an average of 52.03% of the CDR3 amino acid sequences overlapped. MPCR exhibited a certain degree of bias, in which the usage of several genes deviated from 5'RACE, and some V-J pairings were lost. In contrast, there was a smaller rate of effective data from 5'RACE (11.25% less compared with MPCR). Nevertheless, the methodological variability was smaller compared with the biological variability. Through direct comparison, these findings provide novel insights into the two experimental methods, which will prove to be valuable in immune repertoire research and its interpretation. ",1,1,4,3,3
7561033,1995,"Given the range of mIg-binding affinities expressed by Ag-specific B cells, the ligand:receptor affinity threshold for achieving full B cell activation via the mIgM-mediated signaling pathway is quite high. Several recombinant, or semi-purified, cytokines were found to reduce the very high mIgM:ligand affinity threshold for induction of human B cell S phase entry by bivalent, affinity-diverse anti-IgM mAbs without notably affecting the lower affinity threshold for G1-related RNA synthesis. Two-stage culture experiments suggested that one major means by which IL-4, IL-2, and low m.w. B cell growth factor lower the affinity threshold for S phase entry is an indirect one, i.e., rescue of B cells whose mIg engagements with Ag are of sufficient affinity for achieving G1 entry, but of insufficient affinity for initiating the late-phase mIgM-mediated signals needed for the G1-->S phase transition. IL-4 had additional effects in early G1. In contrast to the above cytokines, IFN-gamma, did not function as an independent cell cycle progression factor, but rather required the concomitant presence of mIgM-cross-linking ligand for enhancement. A greater potential of multivalent anti-IgM-dextran conjugates to trigger S phase entry in the absence of cytokines was found to reflect a greater potential for initiating mIgM signals during the late phase in B cell activation. The results indicate that progression of mIgM receptor-activated B cells past a G1-->S phase restriction point is dependent upon continued signal transduction via either the mIgM receptor and/or a cytokine receptor signaling pathway. When mIgM-engaging ligands are ineffective at initiating late-phase signals, due to limited size and binding site valency and/or affinity, ancillary signal transduction through cytokine receptors becomes most relevant.",1,0,1,0,0

A new in vivo screening concept was evaluated as a strategy to increase the speed and efficiency of drug discovery projects in malaria. The new in vivo screening concept was developed based on human disease parameters, i.e. parasitemia in the peripheral blood of patients on hospital admission and parasite reduction ratio (PRR), which were allometrically down-scaled into P. berghei-infected mice. Mice with an initial parasitemia (P0) of 1.5% were treated orally for two consecutive days and parasitemia measured 24 h after the second dose. The assay was optimized for detection of compounds able to stop parasite replication (PRR = 1) or induce parasite clearance (PRR >1) with statistical power >99% using only two mice per experimental group. In the P. berghei in vivo screening assay, the PRR of a set of eleven antimalarials with different mechanisms of action correlated with human-equivalent data. Subsequently, 590 compounds from the Tres Cantos Antimalarial Set with activity in vitro against P. falciparum were tested at 50 mg/kg (orally) in an assay format that allowed the evaluation of hundreds of compounds per month. The rate of compounds with detectable efficacy was 11.2% and about one third of active compounds showed in vivo efficacy comparable with the most potent antimalarials used clinically. High-throughput, high-content in vivo screening could rapidly select new compounds, dramatically speeding up the discovery of new antimalarial medicines. A global multilateral collaborative project aimed at screening the significant chemical diversity within the antimalarial in vitro hits described in the literature is a feasible task. ",1,0,1,0,0
20729471,2010,"The time it takes an enzyme to complete its reaction is a stochastic quantity governed by thermal fluctuations. With the advent of high-resolution methods of single-molecule manipulation and detection, it is now possible to observe directly this natural variation in the enzymatic cycle completion time and extract kinetic information from the statistics of its fluctuations. To this end, the inverse of the squared coefficient of variation, which we term n(min), is a useful measure of fluctuations because it places a strict lower limit on the number of kinetic states in the enzymatic mechanism. Here we show that there is a single general expression for the substrate dependence of n(min) for a wide range of kinetic models. This expression is governed by three kinetic parameters, which we term N(L), N(S), and alpha. These parameters have simple geometric interpretations and provide clear constraints on possible kinetic mechanisms. As a demonstration of this analysis, we fit the fluctuations in the dwell times of the packaging motor of the bacteriophage varphi29, revealing additional features of the nucleotide loading process in this motor. Because a diverse set of kinetic models display the same substrate dependence for their fluctuations, the expression for this general dependence may prove of use in the characterization and study of the dynamics of a wide range of enzymes.",1,0,1,0,0
17823418,2007,"BACKGROUND:
American women aged 25-44 y gain 0.5-1 kg yearly, most of which is fat. Because few midlife women participate in strength training, this mode of activity may be a novel intervention for preventing age-associated fat increases in this population.
OBJECTIVE:
The primary aim was to assess the efficacy of twice-weekly strength training to avoid increases in percentage body fat and intraabdominal fat.
METHODS:
A randomized controlled trial was conducted in an ethnically diverse sample of 164 overweight and obese [body mass index (in kg/m2): 25-35] women aged 25-44 y. The treatment group did twice-weekly strength training for 2 y. The standard care comparison group was given brochures recommending aerobic exercise. Assessments at baseline, 1, and 2 y included intraabdominal fat by computed tomography scan and body fat and fat-free mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
RESULTS:
During 2 y, percentage body fat changes were -3.68 +/- 0.99% for the treatment group and -0.14 +/- 1.04% for the control group, P = 0.01. Two-year intraabdominal fat changes were 7.05 +/- 5.07% for the treatment group and 21.36 +/- 5.34% for the control group, P = 0.05.
CONCLUSIONS:
This study suggests that strength training is an efficacious intervention for preventing percentage body fat increases and attenuating intraabdominal fat increases in overweight and obese premenopausal women. This is relevant to public health efforts for obesity prevention because most weight gain can be assumed to be fat, including abdominal fat.

Symbionts can either be transferred from parent to offspring via direct inheritance (vertical transmission) or acquired anew each generation from the environment (horizontal transmission). With vertical symbiont transmission, progeny benefit by not having to search for their obligate symbionts, and, with symbiont inheritance, a mechanism exists for perpetuating advantageous symbionts. But, if the progeny encounter an environment that differs from that of their parent, they may be disadvantaged if the inherited symbionts prove suboptimal. Conversely, while in horizontal symbiont acquisition host survival hinges on an unpredictable symbiont source, an individual host may acquire genetically diverse symbionts well suited to any given environment. In horizontal acquisition, however, a potentially advantageous symbiont will not be transmitted to subsequent generations. Adaptation in obligate symbioses may require mechanisms for both novel symbiont acquisition and symbiont inheritance. Using denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR, we identified the dinoflagellate symbionts (genus Symbiodinium) hosted by the Red Sea coral Stylophora pistillata throughout its ontogenesis and over depth. We present evidence that S. pistillata juvenile colonies may utilize both vertical and horizontal symbiont acquisition strategies. By releasing progeny with maternally derived symbionts, that are also capable of subsequent horizontal symbiont acquisition, coral colonies may acquire physiologically advantageous novel symbionts that are then perpetuated via vertical transmission to subsequent generations. With symbiont inheritance, natural selection can act upon the symbiotic variability, providing a mechanism for coral adaptation.",1,1,2,0,0
16103101,2005,"By screening 1,990 compounds from the National Cancer Institute diversity set library against human topoisomerase IIalpha, we identified a novel catalytic topoisomerase II inhibitor NSC35866, a S6-substituted analogue of thioguanine. In addition to inhibiting the DNA strand passage reaction of human topoisomerase IIalpha, NSC35866 also inhibited its ATPase reaction. NSC35866 primarily inhibited DNA-stimulated ATPase activity, whereas DNA-independent ATPase activity was less sensitive to inhibition. We compared the mode of topoisomerase II ATPase inhibition induced by NSC35866 with that of 12 other substituted purine analogues of different chemical classes. The ability of thiopurines with free SH functionalities to inhibit topoisomerase II ATPase activity was completely abolished by DTT, suggesting that these thiopurines inhibit topoisomerase II ATPase activity by covalently modifying free cysteine residues. In contrast, NSC35866 as well as two O6-substituted guanine analogues, O6-benzylguanine and NU2058, could inhibit topoisomerase II ATPase activity in the presence of DTT, indicating that they have a different mechanism of inhibition. NSC35866 did not increase the level of topoisomerase II covalent cleavable complexes with DNA, indicating that it is a catalytic inhibitor and not a poison. NSC35866 was also capable of inducing a salt-stable complex of topoisomerase II on closed circular DNA. In accordance with these biochemical data, NSC35866 could antagonize etoposide-induced cytotoxicity and DNA breaks in human and murine cancer cells, confirming that NSC35866 also functions as a catalytic topoisomerase II inhibitor in cells.",1,0,1,0,0

To prevent the associated economic losses, and particularly those related to bacterial diseases where their management relies on removal of the infected material from production, simple, easy-to-perform, rapid and cost-effective tests are needed. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays that target 16S rRNA, fliC and egl genes were compared and evaluated as on-site applications. The assay with the best performance was that targeted to the egl gene, which shows high analytical specificity for diverse strains of the betaproteobacterium Ralstonia solanacearum, including its non-European and non-race 3 biovar 2 strains. The additional melting curve analysis provides confirmation of the test results. According to our extensive assessment, the egl LAMP assay requires minimum sample preparation (a few minutes of boiling) for the identification of pure cultures and ooze from symptomatic material, and it can also be used in a high-throughput format in the laboratory. This provides sensitive and reliable detection of R. solanacearum strains of different phylotypes. ",1,1,2,1,2
30976081,2019,"This paper introduces a deep-learning based computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system for the early detection of acute renal transplant rejection. For noninvasive detection of kidney rejection at an early stage, the proposed CAD system is based on the fusion of both imaging markers and clinical biomarkers. The former are derived from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) by estimating the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) representing the perfusion of the blood and the diffusion of the water inside the transplanted kidney. The clinical biomarkers, namely: creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum plasma creatinine (SPCr), are integrated into the proposed CAD system as kidney functionality indexes to enhance its diagnostic performance. The ADC maps are estimated for a user-defined region of interest (ROI) that encompasses the whole kidney. The estimated ADCs are fused with the clinical biomarkers and the fused data is then used as an input to train and test a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier. The CAD system is tested on DW-MRI scans collected from 56 subjects from geographically diverse populations and different scanner types/image collection protocols. The overall accuracy of the proposed system is 92.9% with 93.3% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity in distinguishing non-rejected kidney transplants from rejected ones. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed system for a reliable non-invasive diagnosis of renal transplant status for any DW-MRI scans, regardless of the geographical differences and/or imaging protocol.",1,0,1,0,0
30964862,2019,"Voltage-sensing phosphatases (VSPs) are transmembrane proteins that couple changes in membrane potential to hydrolysis of inositol signaling lipids. VSPs catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) that regulate diverse aspects of cell membrane physiology including cell division, growth and migration. VSPs are highly conserved among chordates, and their RNA transcripts have been detected in the adult and embryonic stages of frogs, fish, chickens, mice and humans. However, the subcellular localization and biological function of VSP remains unknown. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), we show that both Xenopus laevis VSPs (Xl-VSP1 and Xl-VSP2) mRNAs are expressed in early embryos, suggesting that both Xl-VSPs are involved in early tadpole development. To understand which embryonic tissues express Xl-VSP mRNA, we used in situ hybridization (ISH) and found Xl-VSP mRNA in both the brain and kidney of NF stage 32-36 embryos. By Western blot analysis with a VSP antibody, we show increasing levels of Xl-VSP protein in the developing embryo, and by immunohistochemistry (IHC), we demonstrate that Xl-VSP protein is specifically localized to the apical membrane of both embryonic and adult kidney tubules. We further characterized the catalytic activity of both Xl-VSP homologs and found that while Xl-VSP1 catalyzes 3- and 5-phosphate removal, Xl-VSP2 is a less efficient 3-phosphatase with different substrate specificity. Our results suggest that Xl-VSP1 and Xl-VSP2 serve different functional roles and that VSPs are an integral component of voltage-dependent PIP signaling pathways during vertebrate kidney tubule development and function.",1,1,3,0,1

This paper reviewed new available information regarding possible factors contributing to the establishment of the BV vaginal biofilm, examined the proposed role of anaerobic microbial species recently detected by new culture-independent methods and discusses developments related to the effects of BV on human pregnancy. The literature search included Pubmed (NLM), LISTA (EBSCO), and Web of Science. Because of the complexity and diversity of population groups, diagnosis and methodology used, no meta-analysis was performed.

31365564,2019,"BACKGROUND:
The tobacco industry has aggressively introduced new and diverse products in the market, including electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and heat-not-burn (HNB) tobacco products, to which adolescents are readily susceptible. Conventional cigarettes have a well-established relationship with adolescent risky behaviors such as alcohol and drug use; however, no studies exist on the association between alcohol consumption and use of e-cigarettes or HNB tobacco products among Korean adolescents. This study evaluated alcohol-related behaviors and drug use in relation to whether a Korean nationally representative adolescent sample had ever used e-cigarettes and HNB tobacco products.
METHODS:
Data from the 2018 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey were analyzed. The final study sample comprised 60,040 adolescents. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to examine whether the ever having used e-cigarettes and HNB tobacco products was associated with alcohol-related behaviors and drug use. P-values for trends were calculated to examine the dose-response relationship for each variable.
RESULTS:
Respondents with higher drinking frequency, drinking quantity, alcohol intoxication, alcohol availability, and drug use were more likely to report having used e-cigarettes and HNB tobacco products, thus implying a significant relationship between substance use and novel tobacco product (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS:
Our findings suggest that at-risk adolescents who are engaged in other forms of risk-taking behaviors are prone to attract the experimentation with e-cigarettes or HNB tobacco products. Thus, smoking cessation programs related to substance use should be implemented, and there is an urgent need to monitor and regulate these products effectively.

28657885,2017,"Evolution of bacteria and archaea involves an incessant arms race against an enormous diversity of genetic parasites. Accordingly, a substantial fraction of the genes in most bacteria and archaea are dedicated to antiparasite defense. The functions of these defense systems follow several distinct strategies, including innate immunity; adaptive immunity; and dormancy induction, or programmed cell death. Recent comparative genomic studies taking advantage of the expanding database of microbial genomes and metagenomes, combined with direct experiments, resulted in the discovery of several previously unknown defense systems, including innate immunity centered on Argonaute proteins, bacteriophage exclusion, and new types of CRISPR-Cas systems of adaptive immunity. Some general principles of function and evolution of defense systems are starting to crystallize, in particular, extensive gain and loss of defense genes during the evolution of prokaryotes; formation of genomic defense islands; evolutionary connections between mobile genetic elements and defense, whereby genes of mobile elements are repeatedly recruited for defense functions; the partially selfish and addictive behavior of the defense systems; and coupling between immunity and dormancy induction/programmed cell death.",1,1,2,1,1

23170927,2012,"BACKGROUND:
The influence of community context on the effectiveness of evidence-based maternal and child home visitation programs following implementation is poorly understood. This study compared prenatal smoking cessation between home visitation program recipients and local-area comparison women across 24 implementation sites within one state, while also estimating the independent effect of community smoking norms on smoking cessation behavior.
METHODS:
Retrospective cohort design using propensity score matching of Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) clients and local-area matched comparison women who smoked cigarettes in the first trimester of pregnancy. Birth certificate data were used to classify smoking status. The main outcome measure was smoking cessation in the third trimester of pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis examined, over two time periods, the association of NFP exposure and the association of baseline county prenatal smoking rate on prenatal smoking cessation.
RESULTS:
The association of NFP participation and prenatal smoking cessation was stronger in a later implementation period (35.5% for NFP clients vs. 27.5% for comparison women, p < 0.001) than in an earlier implementation period (28.4% vs. 25.8%, p = 0.114). Cessation was also negatively associated with county prenatal smoking rate, controlling for NFP program effect, (OR = 0.84 per 5 percentage point change in county smoking rate, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS:
Following a statewide implementation, program recipients of NFP demonstrated increased smoking cessation compared to comparison women, with a stronger program effect in later years. The significant association of county smoking rate with cessation suggests that community behavioral norms may present a challenge for evidence-based programs as models are translated into diverse communities.

However, the functional roles of lncRNAs and mechanistic analysis of their interplays with oncogenic pathways in oral cancer remain largely unknown. In the current study, we examined the significance of lncRNA HOTAIR (HOX transcript antisense RNA) in tumor progression of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). We found the expression of HOTAIR was upregulated in tumor tissues, especially in the metastatic samples. And it was also observed in metastatic OSCC cell lines. Silence of HOTAIR in oral carcinomas stem cells (OCSC) significantly inhibited their cancer stemness, invasiveness and tumourigenicity in xenotransplantation models. By contrast, overexpression of HOTAIR in OSCC enhanced their metastatic potential and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics. And we showed that the expression of HOTAIR was positively related to mesenchymal markers and inversely correlated with epithelial marker in clinical samples. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis suggested that high level of HOTAIR was a strong predictor of poor survival in OSCC patients. Collectively, our data demonstrated that HOTAIR-mediated cancer stemness and metastasis are associated with the regulation of EMT and HOTAIR may serve as a therapeutic target in OSCC.",1,0,1,0,0

Outbreaks of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are associated with unsafe injection practices, drug diversion, and other exposures to blood and are difficult to detect and investigate.

We obtained sequences from the HCV hypervariable region 1 (HVR1), using end-point limiting-dilution (EPLD) technique, from 127 cases involved in 32 epidemiologically defined HCV outbreaks and 193 individuals with unrelated HCV strains. We compared several types of genetic distances and calculated a threshold, using minimal Hamming distances, that identifies transmission clusters in all tested outbreaks with 100% accuracy. The approach was also validated on sequences obtained using next-generation sequencing from HCV strains recovered from 239 individuals, and findings showed the same accuracy as that for EPLD. On average, the nucleotide diversity of the intrahost population was 6.2 times greater in the source case than in any incident case, allowing the correct detection of transmission direction in 8 outbreaks for which source cases were known. A simple and accurate distance-based approach developed here for detecting HCV transmissions streamlines molecular investigation of outbreaks, thus improving the public health capacity for rapid and effective control of hepatitis C.

Here we report on superconductivity enhanced by GHz radiation in type II superconducting Pb films in the presence of vortices. The stimulation effect is more clearly observed in the upper critical field and less pronounced in the critical temperature. The magnetic field dependence of the vortex related microwave losses in a film with periodic pinning reveals a reduced dissipation of mobile vortices in the stimulated regime due to a reduction of the core size. Results of numerical simulations support the validy of this conclusion.

20091606,2010,"BACKGROUND:
Shigella dysentery is a relatively common illness and occasionally causes death, worldwide. Mild symptoms are self-limiting but in more severe cases, antibiotics are recommended for cure and preventing relapse. The antibiotics recommended are diverse, have regional differences in sensitivity, and have side effects.
OBJECTIVE:
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for treating Shigella dysentery.
METHODS:
In June 2009 we identified all relevant trials from the following databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). We also checked conference proceedings for relevant abstracts, and contacted researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies.
METHODS:
Randomized controlled trials of antibiotics for Shigella dysentery.
METHODS:
Four authors, working in pairs, independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and used the random-effects model for significant heterogeneity. We explored possible sources of heterogeneity, when present, in subgroup analyses of participant age and percentage of participants with confirmed Shigella infection.
RESULTS:
Sixteen trials (1748 participants), spanning four decades and with differing sensitivity to Shigella isolates, met the inclusion criteria. Seven were judged to be at risk of bias due to inadequate allocation concealment or blinding, and 12 due to incomplete reporting of outcome data. Limited data from one three-armed trial of people with moderately severe illness suggest that antibiotics reduce the episodes of diarrhoea at follow-up (furazolidone versus no drug RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.48, 73 participants; cotrimoxazole versus no drug RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.59, 76 participants).There was insufficient evidence to consider any class of antibiotic superior in efficacy in treating Shigella dysentery, but heterogeneity for some comparisons limits confidence in the results. All the antibiotics studied were safe. There was inadequate evidence regarding the role of antibiotics in preventing relapses.
CONCLUSIONS:
Antibiotics reduce the duration of Shigella dysentery.Regularly updated local or regional antibiotic sensitivity patterns to different species and strains of Shigella are required to guide empiric therapy. More trials adhering to standard guidelines are required to evaluate the role of antibiotics in the treatment of severe forms of Shigella dysentery and in groups who are at high risk of complications.

33208830,2020,"Invasive species are characterized by their ability to colonize new habitats and establish populations away from their native range. In this sense, these plants are expected to have plastic responses to adapt to the environmental pressures during the invasion process. Hence, the role of natural selection is essential because it might favor the occurrence of advantageous traits. However, gene flow can counteract natural selection because immigrants introduce genes adapted to different conditions, with these introductions tending to homogenize allelic frequencies. In this work, we explore the effect of natural selection in invasive populations of S. madagascariensis in Argentina. We quantified leaf area, head number, and length of internodes and inflorescence from material spanning 54 years (1962-2016) and then compared between the edge versus established ranges. Our results show differences in all the measured plant traits among the sampled areas. However, only leaf area was statistically significant, which evidences different responses under the same environmental pressures in the areas located in the edge and established ranges. On the other hand, unlike homogeneous areas, the areas characterized by phenotypically diverse individuals were related to higher dispersal ability. In this sense, long-distance dispersal between neighboring areas may have had an important role in the recorded values. Furthermore, the implications of natural selection and founder effect in the invasion of S. madagascariensis are discussed.",1,1,2,0,1

Transmission of HIV from mother-to-child during pregnancy, labor, or breastfeeding is the primary cause of pediatric HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. A regimen of single-dose nevirapine administered to both HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants has been shown to lower the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. In an effort to facilitate scale-up of PMTCT programs in low-income countries, Boehringer Ingelheim, the manufacturer of Viramune (branded nevirapine), initiated the Viramune Donation Programme (VDP) in 2000. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the VDP on participating institutions.
METHODS:
A total of 164 institutions in 60 countries were included in the VDP over its 11-year duration. An online quantitative and qualitative questionnaire was submitted to all program managers. The questionnaire collected data on the impact of the VDP on initiation and scale-up of PMTCT services, operational capacity, national PMTCT policies, access to funding, and national and international partnerships. Participants were asked for their opinion of how VDP was perceived by different stakeholders (medical community, patients, government authorities, communities).
RESULTS:
Ninety-nine managers (60.4%) in 34 countries responded to the online questionnaire; 89 of institutions (89.9%) were located in Africa The most positive aspects of the VDP identified were: helped to expand PMTCT services (85.9% of program managers), reduced stigma against HIV-positive pregnant women, increased social support mechanisms (78.8%), fostered partnerships with national and international organizations (69.0%), and encouraged access to donor funding (63.0%). Implementation of the VDP triggered improvements in training hospitals and logistical capacity and was associated with changes in policy strategies at the national level.
CONCLUSIONS:
A drug donation program such as the VDP can act as a catalyst for systemic changes at the institutional and national levels. The VDP provides a model for how private initiatives can have a significant impact on public health issues and foster diverse public-private partnerships among governments, commercial organizations, local institutions, and international NGOs.

20562860,2010,"Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in networks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.",1,0,1,0,0

Family history and African-American race are important risk factors for both prostate cancer (CaP) incidence and aggressiveness. When studying complex diseases such as CaP that have a heritable component, chances of finding true disease susceptibility alleles can be increased by accounting for genetic ancestry within the population investigated. Race, ethnicity and ancestry were studied in a geographically diverse cohort of men with newly diagnosed CaP.
METHODS:
Individual ancestry (IA) was estimated in the population-based North Carolina and Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP), a cohort of 2,106 incident CaP cases (2063 with complete ethnicity information) comprising roughly equal numbers of research subjects reporting as Black/African American (AA) or European American/Caucasian/Caucasian American/White (EA) from North Carolina or Louisiana. Mean genome wide individual ancestry estimates of percent African, European and Asian were obtained and tested for differences by state and ethnicity (Cajun and/or Creole and Hispanic/Latino) using multivariate analysis of variance models. Principal components (PC) were compared to assess differences in genetic composition by self-reported race and ethnicity between and within states.
RESULTS:
Mean individual ancestries differed by state for self-reporting AA (p = 0.03) and EA (p = 0.001). This geographic difference attenuated for AAs who answered ""no"" to all ethnicity membership questions (non-ethnic research subjects; p = 0.78) but not EA research subjects, p = 0.002. Mean ancestry estimates of self-identified AA Louisiana research subjects for each ethnic group; Cajun only, Creole only and both Cajun and Creole differed significantly from self-identified non-ethnic AA Louisiana research subjects. These ethnicity differences were not seen in those who self-identified as EA.
CONCLUSIONS:
Mean IA differed by race between states, elucidating a potential contributing factor to these differences in AA research participants: self-reported ethnicity. Accurately accounting for genetic admixture in this cohort is essential for future analyses of the genetic and environmental contributions to CaP.

In this study, we examine the functional competence of a polyclonal population of self-specific CD8+ T cells. We show that low-affinity interactions between TCR and peptide are associated with selective loss of critical T cell functions. Triggering of low levels of IFN-gamma production and cytolytic activity through low-affinity TCRs readily occurs provided high Ag doses are used, but IL-2 production and clonal expansion are severely reduced at all Ag doses. Remarkably, a single peptide variant can form an improved ligand for the highly diverse population of low-avidity self-specific T cells and can improve their proliferative capacity.

By combining a microbiological and geochemical approach, we showed that the chemistry of the CO2- and CH4-rich gas reservoir hosted within the meromictic Lake Averno (Campi Flegrei, southern Italy) are related to the microbial niche differentiation along the vertical water column. The simultaneous occurrence of diverse functional groups of microbes operating under different conditions suggests that these habitats harbor complex microbial consortia that impact on the production and consumption of greenhouse gases. In the epilimnion, the activity of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria and photosynthetic biota, together with CO2 dissolution at relatively high pH, enhanced CO2- and CH4 consumption, which also occurred in the hypolimnion. Moreover, results from computations carried out to evaluate the dependence of the lake stability on the CO2/CH4 ratios, suggested that the water density vertical gradient was mainly controlled by salinity and temperature, whereas the effect of dissolved gases was minor, excepting if extremely high increases of CH4 are admitted. Therefore, biological processes, controlling the composition of CO2 and CH4, contributed to stabilize the lake stratification of the lake. Overall, Lake Averno, and supposedly the numerous worldwide distributed volcanic lakes having similar features (namely bio-activity lakes), acts as a sink for the CO2 supplied from the hydrothermal/magmatic system, displaying a significant influence on the local carbon budget.",1,0,1,0,2

22698695,2012,"Elevated sympathetic nerve activity, strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, is partly generated from the presympathetic neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). The PVN-presympathetic neurons regulating cardiac and vasomotor sympathetic activity receive information about cardiovascular status from receptors in the heart and circulation. These receptors signal changes via afferent neurons terminating in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), some of which may result in excitation or inhibition of PVN-presympathetic neurons. Understanding the anatomy and neurochemistry of NTS afferent connections within the PVN could provide important clues to the impairment in homeostasis cardiovascular control associated with disease. Transynaptic labelling has shown the presence of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-containing neurons and GABA interneurons that terminate on presympathetic PVN neurons any of which may be the target for NTS afferents. So far NTS connections to these diverse neuronal pools have not been demonstrated and were investigated in this study. Anterograde (biotin dextran amine - BDA) labelling of the ascending projection from the NTS and retrograde (fluorogold - FG or cholera toxin B subunit - CTB) labelling of PVN presympathetic neurons combined with immunohistochemistry for GABA and nNOS was used to identify the terminal neuronal targets of the ascending projection from the NTS.

25571394,2014,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) survivors generally retain residual motor and sensory functions, which provide them with the means to control assistive devices. A body-machine interface (BoMI) establishes a mapping from these residual body movements to control commands for an external device. In this study, we designed a BoMI to smooth the way for operating computers, powered wheelchairs and other assistive technologies after cervical spinal cord injuries. The interface design included a comprehensive training paradigm with a range of diverse functional activities to enhance motor learning and retention. Two groups of SCI survivors and healthy control subjects participated in the study. The results indicate the effectiveness of the developed system as an alternative pathway for individuals with motor disabilities to control assistive devices while engaging in functional motor activity.

32857977,2020,"Sphingolipids play important roles in physiology and cell biology, but a systematic examination of their functions is lacking. We performed a genome-wide CRISPRi screen in sphingolipid-depleted human cells and identified hypersensitive mutants in genes of membrane trafficking and lipid biosynthesis, including ether lipid synthesis. Systematic lipidomic analysis showed a coordinate regulation of ether lipids with sphingolipids, suggesting an adaptation and functional compensation. Biophysical experiments on model membranes show common properties of these structurally diverse lipids that also share a known function as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors in different kingdoms of life. Molecular dynamics simulations show a selective enrichment of ether phosphatidylcholine around p24 proteins, which are receptors for the export of GPI-anchored proteins and have been shown to bind a specific sphingomyelin species. Our results support a model of convergent evolution of proteins and lipids, based on their physico-chemical properties, to regulate GPI-anchored protein transport and maintain homeostasis in the early secretory pathway.",1,0,1,0,0
12505029,2003,"HIV-1 comprises three groups, the main (M group), O (outlier) and N (non-M, non-O). The M group, divided into 11 subtypes, is responsible for the global HIV-1 pandemic. Recombination between M subtypes has resulted in the generation of multiple circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) consisting of mosaic lineages. Most subtypes and CRFs are represented in Africa, whereas predominance of one or a few subtypes was reported initially elsewhere. This finding reflects the African origin of the epidemic. In western countries, where the B subtype is predominant, there is a steep increase in non B-subtypes and CRFs, while new recombinants emerge worldwide. Travellers contribute to the spread of HIV-1 genetic diversity worldwide, and in the developing world migration of rural populations and civil war are additional contributing factors. The spreading of HIV-1 variants has implications for diagnostic, treatment, and vaccine development.",1,0,1,0,3
15888658,2005,"Regulation of the process of neuronal death plays a central role both during development of the CNS and in adult brain. The transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) plays a critical role in neuronal survival. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) mediates neurotoxic effects by phosphorylating and inhibiting MEF2. How Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation reduces MEF2 transactivation activity remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which Cdk5, in conjunction with caspase, inhibits MEF2. Using primary cerebellar granule neuron as a model, our investigation reveals that neurotoxicity induces destabilization of MEF2s in neurons. Destabilization of MEF2 is caused by an increase in caspase-dependent cleavage of MEF2. This cleavage event requires nuclear activation of Cdk5 activity. Phosphorylation by Cdk5 alone is sufficient to promote degradation of MEF2A and MEF2D by caspase-3. In contrast to MEF2A and MEF2D, MEF2C is not phosphorylated by Cdk5 after glutamate exposure and, therefore, resistant to neurotoxin-induced caspase-dependent degradation. Consistently, blocking Cdk5 or enhancing MEF2 reduced toxin-induced apoptosis. These findings define an important regulatory mechanism that for the first time links prodeath activities of Cdk5 and caspase. The convergence of Cdk5 phosphorylation-dependent caspase-mediated degradation of nuclear survival factors exemplified by MEF2 may represent a general process applicable to the regulation of other survival factors under diverse neurotoxic conditions.",1,1,2,0,0
11745417,2001,"Evidence has shown that the major human vault protein (MVP), which is identical to lung resistance-related protein (LRP), may be causally involved in a special type of multidrug resistance (MDR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and cellular localization of MVP in cells derived from brain tumors and other tumors of neuroectodermal origin. Using both established cell lines (n = 22) and primary explants (n = 30), we show that a distinct overexpression of the MVP gene at the mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein (Western blot) levels is a characteristic feature of cells derived from astrocytic brain tumors. Primary cultures obtained from meningioma specimens also expressed high MVP levels, in contrast to neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma cells, which rarely contained detectable amounts of MVP. Normal human astrocytes cultured in vitro expressed MVP, although at low amounts compared with most malignant cell types. Basal MVP expression correlated with resistance against diverse antineoplastic drugs including anthracyclins, cisplatin and etoposide. By Western blot, MVP was also detected in all tumor samples taken from 7 glioma and 3 meningioma patients. Taken together, these data suggest overexpression of MVP as one explanation for the low efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatment of astrocytic brain tumors.",1,0,1,0,2
30853225,2018,"OBJECTIVE:
Despite small single-center reports demonstrating acceptable outcomes using donor hearts with left ventricular dysfunction, 19% of potential donor hearts are currently unused exclusively because of left ventricular dysfunction. We investigated modern long-term survival of transplanted donor hearts with left ventricular dysfunction using a large, diverse cohort.
METHODS:
Using the United Network for Organ Sharing database, we reviewed all adult heart transplants between January 2000 and March 2016. Baseline and postoperative characteristics and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared. A covariates-adjusted Cox regression model was developed to estimate post-transplant mortality. To address observed variation in patient profile across donor ejection fraction, a propensity score was built using Cox predictors as covariates in a generalized multiple linear regression model. All the variables in the original Cox model were included. For each recipient, a predicted donor ejection fraction was generated and exported as a new balancing score that was used in a subsequent Cox model. Cubic spline analysis suggested that at most 3 and perhaps no ejection fraction categories were appropriate. Therefore, in 1 Cox model we added donor ejection fraction as a grouped variable (using the spline-directed categories) and in the other as a continuous variable.
RESULTS:
A total of 31,712 donor hearts were transplanted during the study period. A total of 742 donor hearts were excluded for no recorded left ventricular ejection fraction, and 20 donor hearts were excluded for left ventricular ejection fraction less than 20%. Donor hearts with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction were from younger donors, more commonly male donors, and donors with lower body mass index than normal donor hearts. Recipients of donor hearts with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction were more likely to be on mechanical ventilation. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed no significant differences in recipient survival up to 15 years of follow-up (P = .694 log-rank test). Cox regression analysis showed that after adjustment for propensity variation, transplant year, and region, ejection fraction had no statistically significant impact on mortality when analyzed as a categoric or continuous variable. Left ventricular ejection fraction at approximately 1 year after transplantation was normal for all groups.
CONCLUSIONS:
Carefully selected donor hearts with even markedly diminished left ventricular ejection fraction can be transplanted with long-term survival equivalent to normal donor hearts and therefore should not be excluded from consideration on the basis of depressed left ventricular ejection fraction alone. Functional recovery of even the most impaired donor hearts in this study suggests that studies of left ventricular function in the setting of brain death should be interpreted cautiously.

21199843,2011,"Disgust is an evolved psychological system for protecting organisms from infection through disease avoidant behaviour. This 'behavioural immune system', present in a diverse array of species, exhibits universal features that orchestrate hygienic behaviour in response to cues of risk of contact with pathogens. However, disgust is also a dynamic adaptive system. Individuals show variation in pathogen avoidance associated with psychological traits like having a neurotic personality, as well as a consequence of being in certain physiological states such as pregnancy or infancy. Three specialized learning mechanisms modify the disgust response: the Garcia effect, evaluative conditioning and the law of contagion. Hygiene behaviour is influenced at the group level through social learning heuristics such as 'copy the frequent'. Finally, group hygiene is extended symbolically to cultural rules about purity and pollution, which create social separations and are enforced as manners. Cooperative hygiene endeavours such as sanitation also reduce pathogen prevalence. Our model allows us to integrate perspectives from psychology, ecology and cultural evolution with those of epidemiology and anthropology. Understanding the nature of disease avoidance psychology at all levels of human organization can inform the design of programmes to improve public health.",1,1,4,0,0

Although many studies have focused on the adult lung, the perinatal lung remains unexplored. Here, we present an atlas of the murine lung immune compartment during early postnatal development. We show that the late embryonic lung is dominated by specialized proliferative macrophages with a surprising physical interaction with the developing vasculature. These macrophages disappear after birth and are replaced by a dynamic mixture of macrophage subtypes, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes. Detailed characterization of macrophage diversity revealed an orchestration of distinct subpopulations across postnatal development to fill context-specific functions in tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and immunity.

17079531,2006,"OBJECTIVE:
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children over age 2 years spend < or = 2 hours per day with screen media, because excessive viewing has been linked to a plethora of physical, academic, and behavioral problems. The primary goal of this study was to qualitatively explore how a recommendation to limit television viewing might be received and responded to by a diverse sample of parents and their school-age children.
METHODS:
The study collected background data about media use, gathered a household media inventory, and conducted in-depth individual and small group interviews with 180 parents and children ages 6 to 13 years old.
RESULTS:
Most of the children reported spending approximately 3 hours per day watching television. The average home in this sample had 4 television sets; nearly two thirds had a television in the child's bedroom, and nearly half had a television set in the kitchen or dining room. Although virtually all of the parents reported having guidelines for children's television viewing, few had rules restricting the time children spend watching television. Data from this exploratory study suggest several potential barriers to implementing a 2-hour limit, including: parents' need to use television as a safe and affordable distraction, parents' own heavy television viewing patterns, the role that television plays in the family's day-to-day routine, and a belief that children should spend their weekend leisure time as they wish. Interviews revealed that for many of these families there is a lack of concern that television viewing is a problem for their child, and there remains confusion about the boundaries of the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
CONCLUSIONS:
Parents in this study expressed interest in taking steps toward reducing children's television time but also uncertainty about how to go about doing so. Results suggest possible strategies to reduce the amount of time children spend in front of the screen.

28145766,2017,"BACKGROUND:
Studies of nighttime intensivist staffing have yielded mixed results.
GOALS:
To review the association of nighttime intensivist staffing with outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
METHODS:
We searched five databases (2000-2016) for studies comparing in-hospital nighttime intensivist staffing with other nighttime staffing models in adult ICUs and reporting mortality or length of stay. We abstracted data on staffing models, outcomes, and study characteristics and assessed study quality, using standardized tools. Meta-analyses used random effects models.
RESULTS:
Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria: one randomized controlled trial and 17 observational studies. Overall methodologic quality was high. Studies included academic hospitals (n = 10), community hospitals (n = 2), or both (n = 6). Baseline clinician staffing included residents (n = 9), fellows (n = 4), and nurse practitioners or physician assistants (n = 2). Studies included both general and specialty ICUs and were geographically diverse. Meta-analysis (one randomized controlled trial; three nonrandomized studies with exposure limited to nighttime intensivist staffing with adjusted estimates of effect) demonstrated no association with mortality (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.29). Secondary analyses including studies without risk adjustment, with a composite exposure of organizational factors, stratified by intensity of daytime staffing and by ICU type, yielded similar results. Minimal or no differences were observed in ICU and hospital length of stay and several other secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS:
Notwithstanding limitations of the predominantly observational evidence, our systematic review and meta-analysis suggests nighttime intensivist staffing is not associated with reduced ICU patient mortality. Other outcomes and alternative staffing models should be evaluated to further guide staffing decisions.

29131864,2017,"BACKGROUND:
The structure and function of bacterial nucleoid are controlled by histone-like proteins of HU/IHF family, omnipresent in bacteria and also founding archaea and some eukaryotes.HU protein binds dsDNA without sequence specificity and avidly binds DNA structures with propensity to be inclined such as forks, three/four-way junctions, nicks, overhangs and DNA bulges. Sequence comparison of thousands of known histone-like proteins from diverse bacteria phyla reveals relation between HU/IHF sequence, DNA-binding properties and other protein features.
RESULTS:
Performed alignment and clusterization of the protein sequences show that HU/IHF family proteins can be unambiguously divided into three groups, HU proteins, IHF_A and IHF_B proteins. HU proteins, IHF_A and IHF_B proteins are further partitioned into several clades for IHF and HU; such a subdivision is in good agreement with bacterial taxonomy. We also analyzed a hundred of 3D fold comparative models built for HU sequences from all revealed HU clades. It appears that HU fold remains similar in spite of the HU sequence variations. We studied DNA-binding properties of HU from N. gonorrhoeae, which sequence is similar to one of E.coli HU, and HU from M. gallisepticum and S. melliferum which sequences are distant from E.coli protein. We found that in respect to dsDNA binding, only S. melliferum HU essentially differs from E.coli HU. In respect to binding of distorted DNA structures, S. melliferum HU and E.coli HU have similar properties but essentially different from M. gallisepticum HU and N. gonorrhea HU. We found that in respect to dsDNA binding, only S. melliferum HU binds DNA in non-cooperative manner and both mycoplasma HU bend dsDNA stronger than E.coli and N. gonorrhoeae. In respect to binding to distorted DNA structures, each HU protein has its individual profile of affinities to various DNA-structures with the increased specificity to DNA junction.
CONCLUSIONS:
HU/IHF family proteins sequence alignment and classification are updated. Comparative modeling demonstrates that HU protein 3D folding's even more conservative than HU sequence. For the first time, DNA binding characteristics of HU from N. gonorrhoeae, M. gallisepticum and S. melliferum are studied. Here we provide detailed analysis of the similarity and variability of DNA-recognizing and bending of four HU proteins from closely and distantly related HU clades.

IgA is most predominantly produced mucosally and is important for combating infections and allergies. In contrast to mice, humans have two forms of IgA; IgA1 and IgA2 with diverse tissue distribution. In early life, IgA levels might be sub-optimal especially during the fall season when bacterial and viral infections are more common. Therefore, we investigated using human B cells whether T-cell-independent factors -promoting cell survival, class switching and immunoglobulin secretion- BAFF, APRIL, IL-10 and retinoic acid can boost IgA production in the context of viral or bacterial infection. To this end total and naive peripheral blood B cells were stimulated with these factors for 6 days in the presence or absence of TLR7/8 agonist R848 (mimicking viral infection) or TLR9 agonist CpG-ODN (mimicking bacterial infection). We show that BAFF significantly augments IgA2 production in TLR7/8 stimulated mature, but not naïve B cells. In addition, BAFF augments IL-10 production and viability in TLR7/8 and TLR9 stimulated mature B cells.

16894172,2006,"Drosophila neuropeptide F (NPF), a homolog of vertebrate neuropeptide Y, functions in feeding and coordination of behavioral changes in larvae and in modulation of alcohol sensitivity in adults, suggesting diverse roles for this peptide. To gain more insight into adult-specific NPF neuronal functions, we studied how npf expression is regulated in the adult brain. Here, we report that npf expression is regulated in both sex-nonspecific and male-specific manners. Our data show that male-specific npf (ms-npf) expression is controlled by the transformer (tra)-dependent sex-determination pathway. Furthermore, fruitless, one of the major genes functioning downstream of tra, is apparently an upstream regulator of ms-npf transcription. Males lacking ms-npf expression (through tra(F)-mediated feminization) or npf-ablated male flies display significantly reduced male courtship activity, suggesting that one function of ms-npf neurons is to modulate fruitless-regulated sexual behavior. Interestingly, one of the ms-npf neuronal groups belongs to the previously defined clock-controlling dorsolateral neurons. Such ms-npf expression in the dorsolateral neurons is absent in arrhythmic Clock(Jrk) and cycle(02) mutants, suggesting that npf is under dual regulation by circadian and sex-determining factors. Based on these data, we propose that NPF also plays a role in clock-controlled sexual dimorphism in adult Drosophila.",1,1,14,0,0
10097159,1999,"The olfactory system is remarkable in its capacity to discriminate a wide range of odorants through a series of transduction events initiated in olfactory receptor neurons. Each olfactory neuron is expected to express only a single odorant receptor gene that belongs to the G protein coupled receptor family. The ligand-receptor interaction, however, has not been clearly characterized. This study demonstrates the functional identification of olfactory receptor(s) for specific odorant(s) from single olfactory neurons by a combination of Ca2+-imaging and reverse transcription-coupled PCR analysis. First, a candidate odorant receptor was cloned from a single tissue-printed olfactory neuron that displayed odorant-induced Ca2+ increase. Next, recombinant adenovirus-mediated expression of the isolated receptor gene was established in the olfactory epithelium by using green fluorescent protein as a marker. The infected neurons elicited external Ca2+ entry when exposed to the odorant that originally was used to identify the receptor gene. Experiments performed to determine ligand specificity revealed that the odorant receptor recognized specific structural motifs within odorant molecules. The odorant receptor-mediated signal transduction appears to be reconstituted by this two-step approach: the receptor screening for given odorant(s) from single neurons and the functional expression of the receptor via recombinant adenovirus. The present approach should enable us to examine not only ligand specificity of an odorant receptor but also receptor specificity and diversity for a particular odorant of interest.",1,0,1,0,0

To compare racial and ethnic differences between obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns) and other large groups of adult medical specialists who provide the predominant care of women. Whether physician diversity influences their practice locations in underserved areas was also sought.
METHODS:
This cross-sectional study reports an analysis of U.S. national data about racial and ethnic characteristics, gender, and specialty (obstetrics and gynecology, general internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine) of 190,379 physicians who came from three resources (Association of American Medical Colleges Student Records System, Association of American Medical Colleges Minority Physicians Database, American Medical Association Physician Masterfile). Underserved locations were identified as being rural, having 20% or more of the population living in poverty or being federally designated as areas of professional shortages or underserved populations. Bivariate measures of associations were performed to study the association between physician race and ethnicity and their practice location.
RESULTS:
Female physicians in all specialties were more likely than males to be nonwhite, and ob-gyns were most likely to be female (61.9%). Compared with other studied specialists, ob-gyns had the highest proportion of underrepresented minorities (combined, 18.4%), especially black (11.1%) and Hispanic (6.7%) physicians. Underrepresented minority ob-gyns were more likely than white or Asians to practice in federally funded underserved areas or where poverty levels were high.

32760087,2020,"The Drosophila shaggy gene (sgg, GSK-3) encodes multiple protein isoforms with serine/threonine kinase activity and is a key player in diverse developmental signalling pathways. Currently it is unclear whether different Sgg proteoforms are similarly involved in signalling or if different proteoforms have distinct functions. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to tag eight different Sgg proteoform classes and determined their localization during embryonic development. We performed proteomic analysis of the two major proteoform classes and generated mutant lines for both of these for transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis. We uncovered distinct tissue-specific localization patterns for all of the tagged proteoforms we examined, most of which have not previously been characterised directly at the protein level, including one proteoform initiating with a non-standard codon. Collectively, this suggests complex developmentally regulated splicing of the sgg primary transcript. Further, affinity purification followed by mass spectrometric analyses indicate a different repertoire of interacting proteins for the two major proteoforms we examined, one with ubiquitous expression (Sgg-PB) and one with nervous system specific expression (Sgg-PA). Specific mutation of these proteoforms shows that Sgg-PB performs the well characterised maternal and zygotic segmentations functions of the sgg locus, while Sgg-PA mutants show adult lifespan and locomotor defects consistent with its nervous system localisation. Our findings provide new insights into the role of GSK-3 proteoforms and intriguing links with the GSK-3α and GSK-3β proteins encoded by independent vertebrate genes.

26912633,2016,"Ageing of the central nervous system results in a loss of both grey and white matter, leading to cognitive decline. Additional injury to both the grey and white matter is documented in many neurological disorders with ageing, including Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. Accompanying neuronal and glial damage is an inflammatory response consisting of activated macrophages and microglia, innate immune cells demonstrated to be both beneficial and detrimental in neurological repair. This article will propose the following: (i) infiltrating macrophages age differently from central nervous system-intrinsic microglia; (ii) several mechanisms underlie the differential ageing process of these two distinct cell types; and (iii) therapeutic strategies that selectively target these diverse mechanisms may rejuvenate macrophages and microglia for repair in the ageing central nervous system. Most responses of macrophages are diminished with senescence, but activated microglia increase their expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines while diminishing chemotactic and phagocytic activities. The senescence of macrophages and microglia has a negative impact on several neurological diseases, and the mechanisms underlying their age-dependent phenotypic changes vary from extrinsic microenvironmental changes to intrinsic changes in genomic integrity. We discuss the negative effects of age on neurological diseases, examine the response of senescent macrophages and microglia in these conditions, and propose a theoretical framework of therapeutic strategies that target the different mechanisms contributing to the ageing phenotype in these two distinct cell types. Rejuvenation of ageing macrophage/microglia may preserve neurological integrity and promote regeneration in the ageing central nervous system. ",1,1,4,0,0

Current methods for measuring DNA repair capacity (DRC) are relatively labor intensive, often indirect, and usually limited to a single repair pathway. Here, we describe a fluorescence-based multiplex flow-cytometric host cell reactivation assay (FM-HCR) that measures the ability of human cells to repair plasmid reporters, each bearing a different type of DNA damage or different doses of the same type of DNA damage. FM-HCR simultaneously measures repair capacity in any four of the following pathways: nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, base excision repair, nonhomologous end joining, homologous recombination, and methylguanine methyltransferase. We show that FM-HCR can measure interindividual DRC differences in a panel of 24 cell lines derived from genetically diverse, apparently healthy individuals, and we show that FM-HCR may be used to identify inhibitors or enhancers of DRC. We further develop a next-generation sequencing-based HCR assay (HCR-Seq) that detects rare transcriptional mutagenesis events due to lesion bypass by RNA polymerase, providing an added dimension to DRC measurements. FM-HCR and HCR-Seq provide powerful tools for exploring relationships among global DRC, disease susceptibility, and optimal treatment. ",1,0,1,0,0

It has been proposed that p53 and BLM help regulate these functions. We show that p53 and BLM accumulated after hydroxyurea (HU) treatment, and physically associated and co-localized with each other and with RAD51 at sites of stalled DNA replication forks. HU-induced relocalization of BLM to RAD51 foci was p53 independent. However, BLM was required for efficient localization of either wild-type or mutated (Ser15Ala) p53 to these foci and for physical association of p53 with RAD51. Loss of BLM and p53 function synergistically enhanced homologous recombination frequency, indicating that they mediated the process by complementary pathways. Loss of p53 further enhanced the rate of spontaneous sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in Bloom syndrome (BS) cells, but not in their BLM-corrected counterpart, indicating that involvement of p53 in regulating spontaneous SCE is BLM dependent.

30314445,2018,"BACKGROUND:
Transgenerational plasticity occurs when the environmental experience of an organism modifies the growth and development of its progeny. Leaf damage in Mimulus guttatus exhibits transgenerational plasticity mediated through differential expression of hundreds of genes. The epigenetic mechanisms that facilitate this response have yet to be described.
RESULTS:
We performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing in the progeny of genetically identical damaged and control plants and developed a pipeline to compare differences in the mean and variance of methylation between treatment groups. We find that parental damage increases the variability of CG and CHG methylation among progeny, but does not alter the overall mean methylation. Instead it has positive effects in some regions and negative in others. We find 3,396 CHH, 203 CG, and 54 CHG Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) ranging from tens to thousands of base pairs scattered across the genome. CHG and CHH DMRs tended to overlap with transposable elements. CG DMRs tended to overlap with gene coding regions, many of which were previously found to be differentially expressed.
CONCLUSIONS:
Genome-wide increases in methylome variation suggest that parental conditions can increase epigenetic diversity in response to stress. Additionally, the potential association between CG DMRs and differentially expressed genes supports the hypothesis that differential methylation is a mechanistic component of transgenerational plasticity in M. guttatus.

Twelve corpus luteum (CL) specimens were collected during operation, either by laparoscopic surgery for CL rupture or by laparotomy for benign gynecologic conditions.
METHODS:
Surgical excision of 12 human CL.
METHODS:
Proteins analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, Western blotting, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments.
RESULTS:
DAZAP1 is expressed in rat and human luteal cells. Expression of DAZAP1 decreases with advancing stages of CL. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show in vivo interaction of DAZ-like (DAZL) protein with DAZAP1 in the ovarian tissues.
CONCLUSIONS:
The expression patterns of DAZAP1 and DAZL are identical within rat and human ovaries. In mammalian species, DAZAP1 may be involved in diverse reproductive functions, ranging from cell cycle regulation and maturation of oocytes to differentiation of luteal cells.

25278676,2014,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is perhaps the most ubiquitous and successful human pathogen, since it colonizes the stomach of more than half of humankind. Infection with this bacterium is commonly acquired during childhood. Once infected, people carry the bacteria for decades or even for life, if not treated. Persistent infection with this pathogen causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and is also strongly associated with the development of gastric cancer. Despite induction of innate and adaptive immune responses in the infected individual, the host is unable to clear the bacteria. One widely accepted hallmark of H. pylori is that it successfully and stealthily evades host defense mechanisms. Though the gastric mucosa is well protected against infection, H. pylori is able to reside under the mucus, attach to gastric epithelial cells and cause persistent infection by evading immune responses mediated by host. In this review, we discuss how H. pylori avoids innate and acquired immune response elements, uses gastric epithelial cells as mediators to manipulate host T cell responses and uses virulence factors to avoid adaptive immune responses by T cells to establish a persistent infection. We also discuss in this review how the genetic diversity of this pathogen helps for its survival. ",1,1,2,0,0
27227908,2016,"There are inconsistent data on the association of risk of hepatitis virus infection and hepatitis virus-related diseases with the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene.Several common polymorphism sites were targeted to assess the risk of HBV infection, HCV infection, and HBV-related diseases.Meta-analysis combining data for 3547 cases and 2797 controls from 8 studies was performed in this study. Pooled ORs were calculated to measure the risk of hepatitis virus infection and hepatitis virus-related diseases. Fixed-effects pooled ORs were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method.The TLR3 gene was associated with a significantly increased risk of HBV-related diseases among 1355 patients and 1130 controls ([pooled OR, [95%CI]: 1.30, [1.15-1.48] for dominant; 1.77, [1.35-2.31] for recessive; 1.28 [1.16-1.41] for allele frequency). Subgroup analyses by a polymorphism site indicated an increased risk of HCV infection in relation to the TT/CT genotypes of rs3775291 (1.50 [1.11-2.01]), and a decreased risk ascribed to the T allele (0.20 [0.16-0.25]). We also noted an association between rs3775291 and significantly increased risk of HBV-related diseases (2.23 [1.55-3.21]). No significant inter-study heterogeneity or publication bias was detected in the analyses.These data suggest a likely effect on the risk to infect HCV and develop HBV-related diseases for the TLR3 gene. Large-scale studies with racially diverse populations are required to validate these findings. ",1,1,2,1,1
2303712,1990,"It has previously been reported that up to 40% of the molecules of human IgG from pooled plasma (100,000 donations) spontaneously dimerize, whereas IgG prepared from a single donor contains only trace quantities of dimer. We have conducted immunoelectron microscopic analyses on such samples and have verified that the majority of dimers are composed of complexes in which two arms of each molecule are bound in a reciprocal fashion at or near the distal tips of their respective arms as previously seen in bona fide Id-anti-Id complexes. A significant role for Fc was ruled out by showing the formation of dimeric ring structures in purified F(ab')2 samples. Spontaneous dimerization was also observed in pooled bovine or mouse IgG, but not in that from single animals. Radiolabeled monomeric, single donor human IgG was used as a probe to investigate dimer formation; this material readily codimerized with IgG from other donors or from pooled plasma (either human or bovine), but did not dimerize with IgG from the same donor. Subclass analysis of multiple donor human IgG revealed that the most flexible subclass (IgG3) was overrepresented in the dimer fraction, whereas one of the less flexible subclasses (IgG2) was underrepresented. Although IgG2 could dimerize to some extent with IgG of other subclasses, it could not self-dimerize. These data suggest that structural constraints (hinge flexibility) may play a role in limiting dimerization. This suspicion was confirmed by showing that an additional 15.5% of the monomeric IgG fraction from a multidonor sample could dimerize after a chemically induced increase in hinge flexibility. Our results are interpreted to show that, although the number of functionally distinct Id produced by a species is immense, it is nontheless finite. Moreover, the Id repertoire of an individual is much smaller than that of the species. Pooling the IgG from a number of individuals increases the Id diversity, which increases the chance that any given Id-bearing molecular will encounter a complementary partner.",1,1,2,0,0
17251413,2007,"Behavioral plasticity induced by the integration of two sensory signals, such as associative learning, is an important issue in neuroscience, but its evolutionary origin and diversity have not been explored sufficiently. We report here a new type of such behavioral plasticity, which we call butanone enhancement, in Caenorhabditis elegans adult hermaphrodites: C. elegans specifically enhances chemotaxis to butanone by preexposure to butanone and food. Mutant analysis revealed that this plasticity requires the AWC(ON) olfactory neuron, whose fate is known to be determined by the NSY-1/ASK1 MAPKKK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase) cascade as well as the DAF-11 and ODR-1 guanylyl cyclases. These proteins also control many aspects of olfactory sensation/plasticity in AWC neurons and seem to provide appropriate cellular conditions for butanone enhancement in the AWC(ON) neuron. Butanone enhancement also required the functions of Bardet-Biedl syndrome genes in the AWC(ON) neuron but not other genes that control ciliary transport. Furthermore, preexposure to butanone and the odor of food was enough for the enhancement of butanone chemotaxis. These results suggest that the AWC(ON) olfactory neuron may conduct a behavioral plasticity resembling associative learning and that the functions of Bardet-Biedl syndrome genes in sensory cilia may play an important role in this plasticity.",1,1,2,0,0
30605479,2019,"Safety pharmacology screening against a wide range of unintended vital targets using in vitro assays is crucial to understand off-target interactions with drug candidates. With the increasing demand for in vitro assays, ligand- and structure-based virtual screening approaches have been evaluated for potential utilization in safety profiling. Although ligand based approaches have been actively applied in retrospective analysis or prospectively within well-defined chemical space during the early discovery stage (i.e., HTS screening and lead optimization), virtual screening is rarely implemented in later stage of drug discovery (i.e., safety). Here we present a case study to evaluate ligand-based 3D QSAR models built based on in vitro antagonistic activity data against adenosine receptor 2A (A2A). The resulting models, obtained from 268 chemically diverse compounds, were used to test a set of 1,897 chemically distinct drugs, simulating the real-world challenge of safety screening when presented with novel chemistry and a limited training set. Due to the unique requirements of safety screening versus discovery screening, the limitations of 3D QSAR methods (i.e., chemotypes, dependence on large training set, and prone to false positives) are less critical than early discovery screen. We demonstrated that 3D QSAR modeling can be effectively applied in safety assessment prior to in vitro assays, even with chemotypes that are drastically different from training compounds. It is also worth noting that our model is able to adequately make the mechanistic distinction between agonists and antagonists, which is important to inform subsequent in vivo studies. Overall, we present an in-depth analysis of the appropriate utilization and interpretation of pharmacophore-based 3D QSAR models for safety screening.",1,0,1,0,0
31618960,2019,"Millions of people engage in mountain sports activities worldwide. Although leisure-time physical activity is associated with significant health benefits, mountain sports activities also bear an inherent risk for injury and death. However, death risk may vary across various types of mountain sports activities. Epidemiological data represent an important basis for the development of preventive measures. Therefore, the aim of this review is to compare mortality rates and potential risk factors across different (summer) mountain sports activities. A comprehensive literature search was performed on the death risk (mortality) in mountain sports, primarily practiced during the summer season, i.e., mountain hiking, mountain biking, paragliding, trekking, rock, ice and high-altitude climbing. It was found that the death risk varies considerably between different summer mountain sports. Mortality during hiking, trekking and biking in the mountains was lower compared to that during paragliding, or during rock, ice or high-altitude climbing. Traumatic deaths were more common in activities primarily performed by young adults, whereas the number of deaths resulting from cardiovascular diseases was higher in activities preferred by the elderly such as hiking and trekking. Preventive efforts must consider the diversity of mountain sports activities including differences in risk factors and practitioners and may more particularly focus on high-risk activities and high-risk individuals.",1,1,3,0,0
32312014,2020,"BACKGROUND:
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is one of the most common malignant mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. They generally arise from the fourth layer (muscularis propria) and rarely from the second or third layer. Although the manifestations of gastric stromal tumors are diverse, to our knowledge, there are only several cases of an extra-gastric stromal tumor in the literature appearing with a pedunculation. Pedunculated large GISTs are not frequent and compress the neighboring organs. When they were huge, it is difficult to differentiate the origin of the masses. Thus, in the clinical setting, physicians should pay more attention to the pattern of manifestation of the gastric stromal tumor.
UNASSIGNED:
A 62-year-old man had no gastrointestinal symptoms or significant medical and family histories. During the health examination with US, a cystic-solid tumor was found below liver. The results of the physical examination were unremarkable, and routine laboratory data on admission did not show any abnormal findings.
METHODS:
Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a mixed echoic mass measuring 10 × 8 × 8 cm and located below the liver, adjacent to the gastric antrum. After endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, cytopathology showed that the specimen was filled with red blood cells, and it had no malignant cells. Histopathology revealed that the mass was a GIST, and immunohistochemical analysis showed the following: CD117(+), CD34(+), desmin(-), Dog-1(+), Ki-67% <1%, and smooth muscle actin(-).
METHODS:
Surgical resection was performed on the patient.
RESULTS:
The lesion was diagnosed as a gastric stromal tumor with a pedicle and an old hemorrhage. The patient's recovery was uneventful. After surgery, computed tomography at the 6-month and 1-year postoperative follow-up visits did not reveal relapse or any metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS:
In the clinical setting, physicians should pay more attention to the pattern of manifestation of the extra-gastric stromal tumor in patients with a pedicle or hemorrhage. Additionally, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration can be used to make an accurate preoperative diagnosis of such diseases, and its findings can serve as an important basis for surgical excision of the lesions.

28068378,2017,"Apex predators are subject to lethal control in many parts of the world to minimize their impacts on human industries and livelihoods. Diverse communities of smaller predators-mesopredators-often remain after apex predator removal. Despite concern that these mesopredators may be 'released' in the absence of the apex predator and exert negative effects on each other and on co-occurring prey, these interactions have been little studied. Here, we investigate the potential effects of competition and intraguild predation between red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cats (Felis catus) in south-eastern Australia where the apex predator, the dingo (Canis dingo), has been extirpated by humans. We predicted that the larger fox would dominate the cat in encounters, and used a fox-removal experiment to assess whether foxes affect cat abundance, diet, home-range and habitat use. Our results provide little indication that intraguild predation occurred or that cats responded numerically to the fox removal, but suggest that the fox affects some aspects of cat resource use. In particular, where foxes were removed cats increased their consumption of invertebrates and carrion, decreased their home range size and foraged more in open habitats. Fox control takes place over large areas of Australia to protect threatened native species and agricultural interests. Our results suggest that fox control programmes could lead to changes in the way that cats interact with co-occurring prey, and that some prey may become more vulnerable to cat predation in open habitats after foxes have been removed. Moreover, with intensive and more sustained fox control it is possible that cats could respond numerically and alter their behaviour in different ways to those documented herein. Such outcomes need to be considered when estimating the indirect impacts of fox control. We conclude that novel approaches are urgently required to control invasive mesopredators at the same time, especially in areas where apex predators are absent.",1,0,1,0,4

Surprisingly little is known about the association of personality traits with smoking and alcohol consumption in the specific subpopulation of pregnant women. This study analyzed data from a geographically diverse sample of 603 pregnant women, aged 18 years and older, who provided information regarding their smoking and drinking habits before and during pregnancy. We compared women who consumed alcohol or smoked cigarettes before pregnancy with women who quit or continued smoking or drinking during pregnancy. Associations between personality and maladaptive behaviors prior to and during pregnancy were modeled using logistic regression. The study revealed that women who scored high on openness to experience were significantly more likely to continue alcohol consumption during pregnancy (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.01, 1.14, p = .02). This association was maintained after adjusting for potential confounds. This study demonstrated a significant relationship between personality traits and women's likelihood of continued alcohol consumption prior to and during pregnancy.

21765474,2011,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent male malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in Western countries. Current clinical and pathological methods are limited in the prediction of postoperative outcome. It is becoming increasingly evident that small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species are associated with the development and progression of this malignancy. To assess the diversity and abundance of small ncRNAs in PCa, we analyzed the composition of the entire small transcriptome by Illumina/Solexa deep sequencing. We further analyzed the microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures of 102 fresh-frozen patient samples during PCa progression by miRNA microarrays. Both platforms were cross-validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Besides the altered expression of several miRNAs, our deep sequencing analyses revealed strong differential expression of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs). From microarray analysis, we derived a miRNA diagnostic classifier that accurately distinguishes normal from cancer samples. Furthermore, we were able to construct a PCa prognostic predictor that independently forecasts postoperative outcome. Importantly, the majority of miRNAs included in the predictor also exhibit high sequence counts and concordant differential expression in Illumina PCa samples, supported by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Our findings provide miRNA expression signatures that may serve as an accurate tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa.",1,1,2,0,1
16709842,2006,"The Tcrb locus is subject to a host of regulatory mechanisms that impart a strict cell and developmental stage-specific order to variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segment recombination. The Tcrb locus is also regulated by allelic exclusion mechanisms, which restrict functional rearrangements to a single allele. The production of a functional rearrangement in CD4-CD8- double-negative (DN) thymocytes leads to the assembly of a pre-TCR and initiates signaling cascades that allow for DN to CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) differentiation, proliferation, and feedback inhibition of further Vbeta to DJbeta rearrangement. Feedback inhibition is believed to be controlled, in part, by the loss of Vbeta gene segment accessibility during the DN to DP transition. However, the pre-TCR signaling pathways that lead to the inactivation of Vbeta chromatin have not been determined. Because activation of the MAPK pathway is documented to promote DP differentiation in the absence of allelic exclusion, we characterized the properties of Vbeta chromatin within DP thymocytes generated by a constitutively active Raf1 (Raf-CAAX) transgene. Consistent with previous reports, we show that the Raf-CAAX transgene does not inhibit Tcrb recombination in DN thymocytes. Nevertheless, DP thymocytes generated by Raf-CAAX signals display normal down-regulation of Vbeta segment accessibility and normal feedback inhibition of the Vbeta to DJbeta rearrangement. Therefore, our results emphasize the distinct requirements for feedback inhibition in the DN and DP compartments. Although MAPK activation cannot impose feedback in DN thymocytes, it contributes to feedback inhibition through developmental changes that are tightly linked to DN to DP differentiation.",1,0,1,0,0
15968692,2005,"BACKGROUND:
The psychological and social sequelae of secondary lymphedema (SLE) have been an underrecognized and little-researched complication of treatment for breast carcinoma. The reported incidence and prevalence of SLE varied widely (0-48%). Reported reasons for the differences are related to the lack of standard diagnostic and universal assessment criteria.
METHODS:
A comprehensive, computerized search was performed. All combinations of the following keywords were used: arm lymphedema, arm swelling, breast cancer, psychological and social, and quality of life (QOL). Eighteen studies were identified.
RESULTS:
The literature supported the view that SLE leads to psychological and social sequelae. Psychological sequelae included frustration, distress, depression and anxiety. Social sequelae comprised changes in role function, lack of social support and pain and disability. Pain was a significant predictor of psychological and social morbidity. These experiences resulted in diminution of QOL, particularly psychological and social health. This was particularly worrisome because women must attend daily to the precautions and treatments for SLE.
CONCLUSIONS:
Researchers should use psychological and social measures along with physiologic parameters when evaluating the impacts of SLE. Clinicians should work to develop standardized primary prevention programs and limb circumference should be measured at the time of breast carcinoma diagnosis. Gaps in knowledge related to intra/interethnic diversity, poverty, and comorbidities of women with breast carcinoma-related SLE need to be explored. The combined efforts of researchers and clinicians would reinforce awareness and knowledge for women at risk and provide important baseline data for research and practice.

Development of effective prophylactic regimens requires that risks associated with different outcomes be assessed when several processes act together. A multistate competing risk model that derived multiple endpoint probabilities without averaging impacts of covariates over different outcomes or overestimating fractions of survivors was used to estimate the influence of 16 factors simultaneously on four failure types (acute rejection, chronic rejection, death with a functioning graft and all other causes combined). We analyzed 12,413 non-Black and 5,121 Black patients undergoing primary cadaveric kidney transplantation reported to UNOS during 1994-96. Black recipients generally demonstrated higher rates of failure, but the method provided joint probabilities for each failure type and covariate level. To illustrate, a middle-aged Black recipient had probabilities of 6.5%, 5.9%, 2.6% and 6.6% to experience acute rejection failure, chronic rejection failure, death with a functioning graft and other failures, respectively, within 3 years. The corresponding non-Black's chances were 2.9%, 2.5%, 2.7% and 3.6%. The overall 3-year survival equaled 78.4% [100%-(6.5% + 5.9% + 2.6% + 6.6%)] and 88.3% for Blacks and non-Blacks, respectively.

17942685,2007,"Hox transcription factors are essential for shaping body morphology in development and evolution. The control of Hox protein activity in part arises from interaction with the PBC class of partners, pre-B cell transcription factor (Pbx) proteins in vertebrates and Extradenticle (Exd) in Drosophila. Characterized interactions occur through a single mode, involving a short hexapeptide motif in the Hox protein. This apparent uniqueness in Hox-PBC interaction provides little mechanistic insight in how the same cofactors endow Hox proteins with specific and diverse activities. Here, we identify in the Drosophila Ultrabithorax (Ubx) protein a short motif responsible for an alternative mode of Exd recruitment. Together with previous reports, this finding highlights that the Hox protein Ubx has multiple ways to interact with the Exd cofactor and suggests that flexibility in Hox-PBC contacts contributes to specify and diversify Hox protein function.",1,0,1,0,0
16638123,2006,"BACKGROUND:
Dinoflagellates are one of the most important classes of marine and freshwater algae, notable both for their functional diversity and ecological significance. They occur naturally as free-living cells, as endosymbionts of marine invertebrates and are well known for their involvement in ""red tides"". Dinoflagellates are also notable for their unusual genome content and structure, which suggests that the organization and regulation of dinoflagellate genes may be very different from that of most eukaryotes. To investigate the content and regulation of the dinoflagellate genome, we performed a global analysis of the transcriptome of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense under nitrate- and phosphate-limited conditions using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS).
RESULTS:
Data from the two MPSS libraries showed that the number of unique signatures found in A. fundyense cells is similar to that of humans and Arabidopsis thaliana, two eukaryotes that have been extensively analyzed using this method. The general distribution, abundance and expression patterns of the A. fundyense signatures were also quite similar to other eukaryotes, and at least 10% of the A. fundyense signatures were differentially expressed between the two conditions. RACE amplification and sequencing of a subset of signatures showed that multiple signatures arose from sequence variants of a single gene. Single signatures also mapped to different sequence variants of the same gene.
CONCLUSIONS:
The MPSS data presented here provide a quantitative view of the transcriptome and its regulation in these unusual single-celled eukaryotes. The observed signature abundance and distribution in Alexandrium is similar to that of other eukaryotes that have been analyzed using MPSS. Results of signature mapping via RACE indicate that many signatures result from sequence variants of individual genes. These data add to the growing body of evidence for widespread gene duplication in dinoflagellates, which would contribute to the transcriptional complexity of these organisms. The MPSS data also demonstrate that a significant number of dinoflagellate mRNAs are transcriptionally regulated, indicating that dinoflagellates commonly employ transcriptional gene regulation along with the post-transcriptional regulation that has been well documented in these organisms.

28592579,2017,"BACKGROUND:
To understand attitudes and behaviours of adolescents towards antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance and respiratory tract infections.
DESIGN:
Qualitative approach informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were undertaken. We aimed to inform the development of an intervention in an international setting to improve antibiotic use among adolescents; therefore on completion of thematic analysis, findings were triangulated with qualitative data from similar studies in France, Saudi Arabia and Cyprus to elucidate differences in the behaviour change model and adaptation to diverse contexts.
SETTING:
7 educational establishments from the south of England.
PARTICIPANTS:
53 adolescents (16-18 years) participated in seven focus groups and 21 participated in interviews.
RESULTS:
Most participants had taken antibiotics and likened them to other common medications such as painkillers; they reported that their peers treat antibiotics like a 'cure-all' and that they themselves were not interested in antibiotics as a discussion topic. They demonstrated low knowledge of the difference between viral and bacterial infections.Participants self-cared for colds and flu but believed antibiotics are required to treat other RTIs such as tonsillitis, which they perceived as more 'serious'. Past history of taking antibiotics for RTIs instilled the belief that antibiotics were required for future RTIs. Those who characterised themselves as 'non-science students' were less informed about antibiotics and AMR. Most participants felt that AMR was irrelevant to them and their peers. Some 'non-science' students thought resistance was a property of the body, rather than bacteria.
CONCLUSION:
Addressing adolescents' misperceptions about antibiotics and the treatment of RTIs using a behaviour change intervention should help improve antibiotic awareness and may break the cycle of patient demand for antibiotics to treat RTIs amongst this group. Schools should consider educating all students in further education about antibiotic usage and AMR, not only those taking science.

One drug, flubendazole, is a potent inducer of autophagy initiation and flux by affecting acetylated and dynamic microtubules in a reciprocal way. Disruption of dynamic microtubules by flubendazole results in mTOR deactivation and dissociation from lysosomes leading to TFEB (transcription factor EB) nuclear translocation and activation of autophagy.

17878295,2007,"In many taxa, males and females have unequal ratios of sex chromosomes to autosomes, which has resulted in the invention of diverse mechanisms to equilibrate gene expression between the sexes (dosage compensation). Failure to compensate for sex chromosome dosage results in male lethality in Drosophila. In Drosophila, a male-specific lethal (MSL) complex of proteins and noncoding RNAs binds to hundreds of sites on the single male X chromosome and up-regulates gene expression. Here we use population genetics of two closely related Drosophila species to show that adaptive evolution has occurred in all five protein-coding genes of the MSL complex. This positive selection is asymmetric between closely related species, with a very strong signature apparent in Drosophila melanogaster but not in Drosophila simulans. In particular, the MSL1 and MSL2 proteins have undergone dramatic positive selection in D. melanogaster, in domains previously shown to be responsible for their specific targeting to the X chromosome. This signature of positive selection at an essential protein-DNA interface of the complex is unexpected and suggests that X chromosomal MSL-binding DNA segments may themselves be changing rapidly. This highly asymmetric, rapid evolution of the MSL genes further suggests that misregulated dosage compensation may represent one of the underlying causes of male hybrid inviability in Drosophila, wherein the fate of hybrid males depends on which species' X chromosome is inherited.",1,1,11,0,0

To investigate the function of the PH domain of the Ras exchanger Sos, we have generated a recombinant (His)6-tagged PH domain from human Sos1 (PH-Sos).

When microinjected into serum-deprived rat embryo fibroblasts or COS cells, PH-Sos displays a homogenous subcellular distribution. However, PH-Sos rapidly accumulates in the plasma membrane following serum stimulation and, under these conditions, is localized preferentially to the leading edge of motile cells. Surprisingly, the membrane localization of PH-Sos is not dependent on its ability to bind PIP2. Overexpression of the PH domain of Sos has a pronounced dominant-negative effect on serum-induced activation of the Ras signaling pathway. These results suggest that the PH domain of Sos participates in regulating the inducible association of Sos with the membrane, and indicate the presence of specific ligands that interact with this domain to bring about the activation of Ras.",1,0,1,0,0

Classical promoter and enhancer elements are present in appropriate positions 5' of the exons and their utilization results in regulated mCAT-2 mRNA accumulation in skeletal muscle and liver following partial hepatectomy. The isoform adjacent to the most distal promoter is found in all tissues and cell types previously shown to express mCAT-2, while the other 5' UTR isoforms are more tissue specific in their expression. Utilization of some or all of five putative promoters was documented in lymphoma cell clones, liver, and skeletal muscle. TATA-containing and (G+C)-rich TATA-less promoters appear to control mCAT-2 gene expression. The data indicate that the several distinct 5' mCAT-2 mRNA isoforms result from transcriptional initiation at distinct promoters and permit flexible transcriptional regulation of this cationic AA transporter gene.",1,0,1,0,0
31543416,2019,"BACKGROUND:
Group-A human rotaviruses (GARV) are among the major cause of childhood diarrhea worldwide. In lieu of monitoring the circulatory GARV strains and underscoring the burden of GARV related hospitalization, a systematic surveillance was conducted in three hospitals of eastern India. In this hospital-based diarrheal disease surveillance (2014-2016), GARV was the most common cause of acute infantile gastroenteritis. The strains were genotyped and characterized to understand their prevalence and phylodynamics prior to the introduction of vaccine in eastern India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
A total of 3652 stool samples were screened from children (≤5 years) hospitalized with acute diarrhea during 2014-2016. Initial screening for VP6 antigen was done by ELISA. GARV positive samples were genotyped by multiplex semi-nested PCR and DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were based on the capsid proteins VP4 and VP7.
RESULTS:
Of 3652 samples, 1817 (49.8%) were GARV positive. G1, G2, G3 and G9 in conjunction with P[4], P[6]and P[8]genotypes were seen to co-circulate in the population. A sharp deflection from G1 to G3 occurred since 2016; upsurge of G9 strains was seen in alternate years, whereas G2 strains had a low frequency. All the circulating genotypes depicted a low phylogenetic relatedness to the vaccine strains. Differences in antigenic epitopes of VP4 and VP7 proteins in local strains were seen when compared to the vaccine strains. A significant difference in the degree of dehydration, duration of mean hospital stay and frequency of vomiting/24 h between GARV positive and negative children was evident.
CONCLUSION:
The study provides a relevant set of base-line data on high burden of rotaviral gastroenteritis and the varied genotypic diversity among children prior to the introduction of GARV vaccine in this endemic region. Continuous monitoring during post-vaccination era will be required to assess the impact of vaccination in this region.

25928218,2015,"HIV infected individuals in malaria endemic areas experience more frequent and severe malaria episodes compared to non HIV infected. This clinical observation has been linked to a deficiency in antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum antigens; however, prior studies have only focused on the antibody response to <0.5% of P. falciparum proteins. To obtain a broader and less-biased view of the effect of HIV on antibody responses to malaria we compared antibody profiles of HIV positive (HIV+) and negative (HIV-) Rwandan adults with symptomatic malaria using a microarray containing 824 P. falciparum proteins. We also investigated the cellular basis of the antibody response in the two groups by analyzing B and T cell subsets by flow cytometry. Although HIV malaria co-infected individuals generated antibodies to a large number of P. falciparum antigens, including potential vaccine candidates, the breadth and magnitude of their response was reduced compared to HIV- individuals. HIV malaria co-infection was also associated with a higher percentage of atypical memory B cells (MBC) (CD19+CD10-CD21-CD27-) compared to malaria infection alone. Among HIV+ individuals the CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load only partially explained variability in the breadth of P. falciparum-specific antibody responses. Taken together, these data indicate that HIV malaria co-infection is associated with an expansion of atypical MBCs and a diminished antibody response to a diverse array of P. falciparum antigens, thus offering mechanistic insight into the higher risk of malaria in HIV+ individuals.

24963113,2014,"OBJECTIVE:
An evidence-based synthesis of patient preferences for management of hyperglycemia is needed. Our objective was to systematically review patient preferences for noninsulin diabetes medications in adults with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS:
We searched the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and EconLit databases for articles published on or before 23 January 2013. We included English-language studies of adult patients with type 2 diabetes that assessed patient preferences for diabetes medication treatment. Titles, abstracts, and articles were reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. Study data and quality were abstracted with standard protocols.
RESULTS:
Of 2,811 titles identified in our original search, 10 articles met inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Studies were conducted from 2007 to 2012 among diverse patient populations in the U.S., Sweden, Denmark, and the U.K. Methods used to assess patient preferences included discrete choice experiments (e.g., conjoint analysis), time tradeoff exercises, standard gamble, and patient surveys. Key attributes of diabetes medication associated with patient preferences included treatment benefits (e.g., glycemic control and weight loss/control), treatment burden (e.g., administration, frequency, and cost), and side effects (e.g., weight gain, gastrointestinal effects, and hypoglycemia).
CONCLUSIONS:
Various clinical and quality of life-related factors influence patient preferences for noninsulin diabetes medications. Treatment efficacy with regard to glycemic control and weight loss/control and the risk of treatment-related hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal effects are reported to be important drivers of patient treatment selections. Future work is needed to identify practical methods for incorporating patient preferences into treatment decision making and patient-centered care.

15485351,2004,"Over the past two decades, detailed studies of mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome have increased our understanding of the history and population genetics of Native American populations. Variation in autosomal DNA has also been investigated, but to a more limited extent. A low level of genetic diversity in Native American populations is a robust finding from all lines of evidence. In contrast to the previous multiple migration scenarios for the Pleistocene peopling of the Americas, it now seems that a single migration satisfactorily explains the genetic data. Native Americans show greater genetic similarity to populations in east central Asia than they do to the current easternmost Siberian populations. Recent studies on the Y chromosome indicate a date of entry (about 17,000 years ago) into the Americas roughly consistent with the archaeological record. Native Americans experienced two episodes of reduced population size: one with the peopling of the Americas and the other with European contact. The former is the more important determinant for the number of gene lineages and founding haplotypes seen in populations. It may also be an important determinant of the genetic variation underlying common complex diseases, and especially diabetes. The tribal structure of contemporary Native American populations is relevant to the distribution of rare Mendelian disorders because most tribes constitute relatively small, semi-independent gene pools. This leads us to expect that the allelic spectrum for Mendelian diseases will be simple within individual tribes but complex for Native Americans as a whole.",1,0,1,6,13
22662170,2012,"Between 1996 and 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control reported that the only category of food-borne infections increasing in frequency were those caused by members of the genus Vibrio. The gram-negative bacterium Vibrio vulnificus is a ubiquitous inhabitant of estuarine waters, and is the number one cause of seafood-related deaths in the US. Many V. vulnificus isolates have been studied, and it has been shown that two genetically distinct subtypes, distinguished by 16S rDNA and other gene polymorphisms, are associated predominantly with either environmental or clinical isolation. While local genetic differences between the subtypes have been probed, only the genomes of clinical isolates have so far been completely sequenced. In order to better understand V. vulnificus as an agent of disease and to identify the molecular components of its virulence mechanisms, we have completed whole genome shotgun sequencing of three diverse environmental genotypes using a pyrosequencing approach. V. vulnificus strain JY1305 was sequenced to a depth of 33×, and strains E64MW and JY1701 were sequenced to lesser depth, covering approximately 99.9% of each genome. We have performed a comparative analysis of these sequences against the previously published sequences of three V. vulnificus clinical isolates. We find that the genome of V. vulnificus is dynamic, with 1.27% of genes in the C-genotype genomes not found in the E- genotype genomes. We identified key genes that differentiate between the genomes of the clinical and environmental genotypes. 167 genes were found to be specifically associated with environmental genotypes and 278 genes with clinical genotypes. Genes specific to the clinical strains include components of sialic acid catabolism, mannitol fermentation, and a component of a Type IV secretory pathway VirB4, as well as several other genes with potential significance for human virulence. Genes specific to environmental strains included several that may have implications for the balance between self-preservation under stress and nutritional competence.",1,0,1,0,0

Changes in galectin-3 expression and subcellular and intercellular localizations are commonly seen in cancer and pre-cancerous conditions. It is increasingly recognized that galectin-3 is an important regulator of a broad range of cancer cell activities and plays important roles in cancer cell growth, transformation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, adhesion, invasion and metastasis. Such a divergent influence of galectin-3 on cancer cell activities derives from its multiple inter- and sub-cellular localizations where it interacts with a range of different binding partners.

8862400,1996,"Identification of regulators of p53 expression is a crucial step in understanding the diverse functions of p53 and its role in cellular homeostasis and responsiveness to insult. Several viral proteins inactivate p53 as a modulator of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Here, we report that a unique leporipoxviral transcription factor greatly increases levels of p53 mRNA. C7, an early transcription factor from malignant rabbit fibroma virus (MV), is an important determinant of MV virulence. Its effects on cellular gene expression were studied both during MV infection and in isolation, with C7 DNA cloned into a pKC4 expression plasmid. In both settings, C7 caused increased p53 mRNA levels. The increased p53 mRNA reflected new transcription. C7-induced increased transcription was selective: mRNAs for some cellular genes increased but those for many other genes (e.g., Bc12) were unchanged. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analysis of pKC7-transfected and MV-infected cells showed that increased transcription led to an increase in p53 protein. EMSA analysis suggested that C7 bound the human p53 promoter between -240 and -614 bp. These studies document the direct effects of a viral transcription factor on cellular gene expression, specifically that it upregulates p53 transcription.",1,0,1,0,0

We further characterized a novel URF strain isolated from an HIV-infected MSM, GD698. Near full-length genome (NFLG) phylogenic analysis showed that this novel URF was composed of CRF07_BC and CRF55_01B, with two recombinant breakpoints (nt 6,003 and 8,251 relative to the HXB2 genome) in the vpu/env and env genes, respectively. Twenty six percent of the genome is classified as CRF55_01B, spanning part of vpu and most of the env gene. The remaining 74% of the genome is classified as CRF07_BC. Both the backbone CRF07_BC sequence and CRF55_01B fragment were clustered with the HIV-1 isolates found in MSM. The emergence of the novel HIV-1 recombinant indicates the ongoing recombinants derived from the CRF07_BC and CRF55_01B isolates, and provides critical insights into our understanding of the dynamics and complexity of the HIV-1 epidemic in China.",1,1,4,0,2
27329863,2016,"MOTIVATION:
Graphical models are often employed to interpret patterns of correlations observed in data through a network of interactions between the variables. Recently, Ising/Potts models, also known as Markov random fields, have been productively applied to diverse problems in biology, including the prediction of structural contacts from protein sequence data and the description of neural activity patterns. However, inference of such models is a challenging computational problem that cannot be solved exactly. Here, we describe the adaptive cluster expansion (ACE) method to quickly and accurately infer Ising or Potts models based on correlation data. ACE avoids overfitting by constructing a sparse network of interactions sufficient to reproduce the observed correlation data within the statistical error expected due to finite sampling. When convergence of the ACE algorithm is slow, we combine it with a Boltzmann Machine Learning algorithm (BML). We illustrate this method on a variety of biological and artificial datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art approximate methods such as Gaussian and pseudo-likelihood inference.
RESULTS:
We show that ACE accurately reproduces the true parameters of the underlying model when they are known, and yields accurate statistical descriptions of both biological and artificial data. Models inferred by ACE more accurately describe the statistics of the data, including both the constrained low-order correlations and unconstrained higher-order correlations, compared to those obtained by faster Gaussian and pseudo-likelihood methods. These alternative approaches can recover the structure of the interaction network but typically not the correct strength of interactions, resulting in less accurate generative models.

22552288,2012,"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is one of the most commonly misregulated signaling pathways in human cancers, but its impact on the tumor microenvironment has not been considered as deeply as its autonomous impact on tumor cells. In this study, we show that NF-κB is activated by the two most common PI3K mutations, PIK3CA E545K and H1047R. We found that markers of NF-κB are most strongly upregulated under conditions of growth factor deprivation. Gene expression analysis conducted on cells deprived of growth factors identified the repertoire of genes altered by oncogenic PI3K mutations following growth factor deprivation. This gene set most closely correlated with gene signatures from claudin-low and basal-like breast tumors, subtypes frequently exhibiting constitutive PI3K/Akt activity. An NF-κB-dependent subset of genes driven by oncogenic PI3K mutations was also identified that encoded primarily secreted proteins, suggesting a paracrine role for this gene set. Interestingly, while NF-κB activated by oncogenes such as Ras and EGF receptor leads to cell-autonomous effects, abrogating NF-κB in PI3K-transformed cells did not decrease proliferation or induce apoptosis. However, conditioned media from PI3K mutant-expressing cells led to increased STAT3 activation in recipient THP-1 monocytes or normal epithelial cells in a NF-κB and interleukin-6-dependent manner. Together, our findings describe a PI3K-driven, NF-κB-dependent transcriptional profile that may play a critical role in promoting a microenvironment amenable to tumor progression. These data also indicate that NF-κB plays diverse roles downstream from different oncogenic signaling pathways.",1,0,1,0,0
33166352,2020,"Cancer research in the news is often associated with sensationalised and inaccurate reporting, which may give rise to false hopes and expectations. The role of study selection for cancer-related news stories is an important but less commonly acknowledged issue, as the outcomes of primary research are generally less reliable than those of meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Few studies have investigated the quality of research that makes the news and no previous analyses of the proportions of primary and secondary research in the news have been found in the literature. We analysed distribution of study types, research sources, reporting quality, gender bias, and national bias in online news reports by four major news outlets in USA, UK and Australia over six-months. We measured significant variation in reporting quality and observed biases in many aspects of cancer research reporting, including the types of study selected for coverage, the spectrum of cancer types, gender of scientists, and geographical source of research represented. We discuss the implications of these findings for guiding accurate, contextual reporting of cancer research, which is critical in helping the public understand complex science, appreciate the outcomes of publicly-funded research, maintain trust, and assist informed decision-making. The striking gender bias observed may compromise high-quality coverage of research by limiting diversity of opinion, reinforces stereotypes and skews public visibility and recognition towards male scientists.

11506823,2001,"One of the major mechanisms of protection against carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and other forms of toxicity mediated by carcinogens is the induction of enzymes involved in their metabolism, particularly phase 2 enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, and quinone reductases. Animal studies indicate that induction of phase 2 enzymes is a sufficient condition for obtaining chemoprevention and can be achieved by administering any of a diverse array of naturally-occurring and synthetic chemopreventive agents. Indeed, monitoring of enzyme induction has led to the recognition or isolation of novel, potent chemopreventive agents such as 1,2-dithiole-3-thiones, terpenoids and the isothiocyanate sulforaphane. For example, oltipraz, a substituted 1,2-dithiole-3-thione originally developed as an antischistosomal agent, possesses chemopreventive activity against different classes of carcinogens targeting multiple organs. Mechanistic studies in rodent models for chemoprevention of aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1))-induced hepatocarcinogenesis by oltipraz indicates that increased expression of phase 2 genes is of central importance, although inhibition of phase 1 activation of AFB(1) can also contribute to protection. Exposure of rodents to 1,2-dithiole-3-thiones triggers nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor Nrf2 and its enhanced binding to the ""antioxidant response element"" (ARE), leading to transcriptional activation of a score of genes involved in carcinogen detoxication and attenuation of oxidative stress. Nrf2-deficient mice fail to induce many of these genes in response to dithiolethiones; moreover, basal expression of these genes is typically repressed. To test the hypothesis that enzyme induction is a useful strategy for chemoprevention in humans, three key elements are necessary: a candidate agent, an at-risk population and modulatable intermediate endpoints. Towards this end, a placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trial of oltipraz was conducted in residents of Qidong, PR China who are exposed to dietary aflatoxins and who are at high risk for the development of liver cancer. Oltipraz significantly enhanced excretion of a phase 2 product, aflatoxin-mercapturic acid, a derivative of the aflatoxin-glutathione conjugate, in the urine of study participants administered 125 mg oltipraz by mouth daily. Administration of 500 mg oltipraz once a week led to a significant reduction in the excretion of the primary oxidative metabolite of AFB(1), AFM(1), when measured shortly after drug administration. While this study highlighted the general feasibility of inducing phase 2 enzymes in humans, a longer term intervention is addressing whether protective alterations in aflatoxin metabolism can be sustained for extended periods of time in this high-risk population.",1,1,2,0,1
14538143,1999,Industrial processes often produce wastewaters that resist biological treatment owing to the unfamiliarity of some components to biological systems.

The requirements for and toxicity of different micronutrients vary according to the nature of the waste and the ecology of the sludge.

15173063,2004,"OBJECTIVE:
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell growth and survival and may contribute to drug resistance. bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, exhibits clinical activity against diverse malignancies when administered with cytotoxic chemotherapy. We conducted a Phase II clinical trial of bevacizumab administered after chemotherapy to adults with refractory or relapsed AML, using a timed sequential therapy (TST) approach.
METHODS:
bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was administered on day 8 after 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine 2 g/m(2)/72 h beginning day 1 and mitoxantrone 40 mg/m(2) beginning day 4. In vivo laboratory correlates included AML cell VEGF receptor-1 (FLT-1) expression, marrow microvessel density, and free serum VEGF before and during TST with bevacizumab.
RESULTS:
Forty-eight adults received induction therapy. Myelosuppression occurred in all of the patients similar to other TST regimens. Toxicities were decreased ejection fraction (6%), cerebrovascular bleed (4%), and mortality of 15%. Overall response was 23 of 48 (48%), with complete response (CR) in 16 (33%). Eighteen (14 CR and 4 partial response) underwent one consolidation cycle and 5 (3 CR and 2 partial response) underwent allogeneic transplant. Median overall and disease-free survivals for CR patients were 16.2 months (64%, 1 year) and 7 months (35%, 1 year). Marrow blasts demonstrated FLT-1 staining before bevacizumab and marked decrease in microvessel density after bevacizumab. VEGF was detected in pretreatment serum in 67% of patients tested, increased by day 8 in 52%, and decreased in 93% (67% undetectable) 2 h after bevacizumab.
CONCLUSIONS:
In this single arm study, cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by bevacizumab yields a favorable CR rate and duration in adults with AML that is resistant to traditional treatment approaches. The clearance of marrow blasts in some patients after bevacizumab suggests that VEGF neutralization might result directly in leukemic cell death. The potential biological and clinical activity of bevacizumab in AML warrants additional clinical and laboratory study.

7635050,1995,"A bronchial xenograft model of the human airway was used to identify submucosal gland progenitor cells within the surface airway epithelium. Lineage analysis using recombinant retroviruses has demonstrated considerable diversity in the cellular composition of expanded clones within reconstituted xenograft airway epithelium. These findings provide evidence for the existence of multiple progenitors in the airway with either limited or pluripotent capacity for differentiation. Furthermore, the development of transgene-expressing submucosal glands was associated with a single subset of surface airway epithelial clones. This gland progenitor cell demonstrated two discernible characteristics consistent with the identification of an airway stem cell including: (1) pluripotent capacity for airway differentiation and (2) a two-fold higher proliferative rate than other observed clone types. The number of progenitor cells involved in gland development was also assessed by clonal analysis using alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase transgenes. These studies demonstrated that more than one airway progenitor cell is involved in the initial stages of gland development. A second explanation for the high prevalence of non-clonality in developing glands was suggested from three-dimensional reconstruction of transgene marked glands. These reconstruction experiments demonstrated that 27% of glands contained more than one duct to the surface airway epithelium. This observation suggests a novel mechanism of gland morphogenesis by which independently formed glands interact to join glandular lumens. Such a mechanism of glandular development and morphogenesis may play an important role in normal submucosal gland development and/or the progression of hypersecretory diseases of the adult human airway as seen in cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis and asthma. The identification of progenitor cells with the capacity to form submucosal glands has implications on the targets for gene therapy in cystic fibrosis.",1,1,2,0,0

7902784,1993,"The increased incidence and prevalence of congestive heart failure place a high priority on novel treatment strategies. Left ventricular ejection fraction remains the single most valuable measurement providing both diagnostic and prognostic insights. The most systematic approach to heart failure involves an objective assessment of functional disability, to include exercise tests such as a 6-minute walk under standardized conditions. Left ventricular dysfunction incites a host of neurohumoral compensations that are of fundamental importance in the heart failure syndrome expression. Both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator neurohormones are stimulated and provide new therapeutic opportunities. The therapeutic approach to heart failure begins with a strong emphasis on prevention, patient education, and self-participation in therapy with respect to both its monitoring and adjustment. Diuretics remain a mainstay of therapy but, in the face of severe heart failure, may become ineffectual, requiring constant infusion of loop-active diuretics, combination diuretics, or diuretics in association with concomitant low-dose dopamine infusion. Vasodilator therapy has been an important advance: combination hydralazine and nitrate therapy was initially shown to be efficacious in improving survival, and more recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in the form of enalapril, have shown incremental benefit on survival over this combination. Interestingly, there is now evidence from both SOLVD and SAVE to demonstrate an unexpected and, as yet, unexplained reduction in the frequency of both unstable angina and myocardial infarction. Although, on balance, the weight of evidence concerning the long-term efficacy of inotropic agents has been disappointing, especially as it relates to their unfavorable effects on survival, recent information on vesnarinone, an agent with a complex and diversified mechanism of action, suggests that with appropriate doses, improved symptoms and survival are possible. A substantial amount of new information from randomized placebo-controlled trials attests to the symptomatic relief, hemodynamic improvement, and gain in exercise performance achieved by digoxin. A long-term survival study is ongoing to assess its effects on mortality. beta-Blockers, especially metoprolol, appear beneficial in some patients with heart failure, possibly related to their reduction in sympathetic nervous activity and restoration of beta-receptor population, with resultant improved contractile performance, enhanced myocardial relaxation, and overall increase in cardiac efficiency. Based on available evidence, the best contemporary approach to treatment involves the use of ACE inhibitors coupled with diuretic therapy, either continuous or intermittent, to relieve central or peripheral congestion. The addition of digoxin or a hydralazine nitrate combination is a logical next step, with commencement of low-dose beta-blocker a reasonable option.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1,1,2,0,0
20975950,2010,"Zn²(+)-finger proteins comprise one of the largest protein superfamilies with diverse biological functions. The ATM substrate Chk2-interacting Zn²(+)-finger protein (ASCIZ; also known as ATMIN and ZNF822) was originally linked to functions in the DNA base damage response and has also been proposed to be an essential cofactor of the ATM kinase. Here we show that absence of ASCIZ leads to p53-independent late-embryonic lethality in mice. Asciz-deficient primary fibroblasts exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA base damaging agents MMS and H2O2, but Asciz deletion knock-down does not affect ATM levels and activation in mouse, chicken, or human cells. Unexpectedly, Asciz-deficient embryos also exhibit severe respiratory tract defects with complete pulmonary agenesis and severe tracheal atresia. Nkx2.1-expressing respiratory precursors are still specified in the absence of ASCIZ, but fail to segregate properly within the ventral foregut, and as a consequence lung buds never form and separation of the trachea from the oesophagus stalls early. Comparison of phenotypes suggests that ASCIZ functions between Wnt2-2b/ß-catenin and FGF10/FGF-receptor 2b signaling pathways in the mesodermal/endodermal crosstalk regulating early respiratory development. We also find that ASCIZ can activate expression of reporter genes via its SQ/TQ-cluster domain in vitro, suggesting that it may exert its developmental functions as a transcription factor. Altogether, the data indicate that, in addition to its role in the DNA base damage response, ASCIZ has separate developmental functions as an essential regulator of respiratory organogenesis.",1,0,1,0,0
20157158,2010,"OBJECTIVE:
To explore a potential expansion of the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of Finnish variant late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), we screened a collection of 47 patients with clinically diagnosed NCL in whom no molecular diagnosis had been made.
METHODS:
We used PCR amplification of genomic DNA, followed by fluorescent-labeled dideoxy-nucleotide chain termination sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, to screen our cohort of patients for mutations in CLN5. We collected ethnic background, clinical, and pathologic information, as available, to clarify the breadth of CLN5 disease expression and to explore possible genotype-phenotype correlations.
RESULTS:
We identified 10 patients with pathogenic CLN5 mutations, including 11 mutations not previously described: 4 missense, 5 out-of-frame insertion/deletion mutations, and 2 large intragenic deletions. We also documented 3 previously reported CLN5 mutations. The age at disease onset in this cohort is predominantly juvenile rather than late infantile. Importantly, we have identified 2 adult-onset patients who share a common pathogenic allele. The majority of patients presented with motor and visual impairments and not seizures. In those patients with available longitudinal data, most had progressed to global neurodevelopmental and visual failure with seizures within 1 to 4 years.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our study suggests that CLN5 mutations 1) are more common in patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) than previously reported, 2) are found in non-Finnish NCL patients of broad ethnic diversity, and 3) can be identified in NCL patients with disease onset in adult and juvenile epochs. CLN5 genetic testing is warranted in a wider population with clinical and pathologic features suggestive of an NCL disorder.

27148257,2016,"Influenza viral evolution presents a formidable challenge to vaccination due to the virus' ability to rapidly mutate to evade immune responses. Live influenza infections generate large and diverse CD4 effector T cell responses that yield highly protective, long-lasting CD4 T cell memory that can target conserved viral epitopes. We review advances in our understanding of mechanisms involved in generating CD4 T cell responses against the influenza A virus (IAV), focusing on specialized follicular helper (TFH) and CD4 cytotoxic (ThCTL) effector subsets and on CD4 T cell memory. We also discuss two recent findings in context of enhancing vaccine responses. First, helper T cells require priming with APC secreting high levels of IL-6. Second, the transition of IAV-generated effectors to memory depends on IL-2, costimulation and antigen signals, just before effectors reach peak numbers, defined as the ""memory checkpoint."" The need for these signals during the checkpoint could explain why many current influenza vaccines are poorly effective and elicit poor cellular immunity. We suggest that CD4 memory generation can be enhanced by re-vaccinating at this time. Our best hope lies in a universal vaccine that will not need to be formulated yearly against seasonal antigenically novel influenza strains and will also be protective against a pandemic strain.

22520141,2012,"The efficacy of the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (PRV), RotaTeq(®), was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III clinical trial conducted (April 2007-March 2009) in 3 low-income countries in Africa: Ghana, Kenya, and Mali. In total, 5468 infants were randomized 1:1 to receive 3 doses of PRV/placebo at approximately 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age; concomitant administration with routine EPI vaccines, including OPV, was allowed. HIV-infected infants were not excluded. The primary endpoint, vaccine efficacy (VE) against severe-rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE), as measured by Vesikari scoring system (VSS, score ≥11), from ≥14 days following Dose 3 through a follow-up period of nearly 2 years in the combined 3 African countries, and secondary endpoints by total follow-up period have been previously reported. In this study, we report post hoc subgroup analyses on secondary endpoints of public health importance. VE against RVGE of any severity was 49.2% (95%CI: 29.9, 63.5) through the first year of life and 30.5% (95%CI: 16.7, 42.2) through the complete follow-up period. VE against severe-gastroenteritis of any etiology was 21.5% (95%CI: <0, 38.4) through the first year of life and 10.6% (95%CI: <0, 24.9) through the complete follow-up period. Through the complete follow-up period, VE against severe-RVGE caused by (i) vaccine-contained G and P types (G1-G4, P1A[8]), (ii) non-vaccine G types (G8, G9, G10), and (iii) non-vaccine P types (P1B[4], P2A[6]) was 34.0% (95%CI:11.2, 51.2), 81.8% (95%CI:16.5, 98.0) and 40.7% (95%CI:8.4, 62.1), respectively. There was a trend towards higher VE with higher disease severity, although in some cases the numbers were small. In African countries with high under-5 mortality rates, PRV significantly reduced RVGE through nearly 2 years of follow-up; more modest reductions were observed against gastroenteritis of any etiology. PRV provides protection against severe-RVGE caused by diverse rotavirus genotypes, including those not contained in the vaccine.",1,1,3,0,6
31940377,2020,"The acceptance of students to a medical school places a considerable emphasis on performance in standardized tests and undergraduate grade point average (uGPA). Traditionally, applicants may be judged as a homogeneous population according to simple quantitative thresholds that implicitly assume a linear relationship between scores and academic success. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach ignores the notion that individuals may show distinct patterns of achievement and follow diverse paths to success. In this study, we examined a dataset composed of 53 variables extracted from the admissions application records of 1,088 students matriculating to NYU School of Medicine between the years 2006-2014. We defined training and test groups and applied K-means clustering to search for distinct groups of applicants. Building an optimized logistic regression model, we then tested the predictive value of this clustering for estimating the success of applicants in medical school, aggregating eight performance measures during the subsequent medical school training as a success factor. We found evidence for four distinct clusters of students-we termed 'signatures'-which differ most substantially according to the absolute level of the applicant's uGPA and its trajectory over the course of undergraduate education. The 'risers' signature showed a relatively higher uGPA and also steeper trajectory; the other signatures showed each remaining combination of these two main factors: 'improvers' relatively lower uGPA, steeper trajectory; 'solids' higher uGPA, flatter trajectory; 'statics' both lower uGPA and flatter trajectory. Examining the success index across signatures, we found that the risers and the statics have significantly higher and lower likelihood of quantifiable success in medical school, respectively. We also found that each signature has a unique set of features that correlate with its success in medical school. The big data approach presented here can more sensitively uncover success potential since it takes into account the inherent heterogeneity within the student population.",1,0,1,0,0
18493041,2008,"Small RNA-guided gene silencing is an evolutionarily conserved process that operates by a variety of molecular mechanisms. In multicellular eukaryotes, the core components of RNA-mediated silencing have significantly expanded and diversified, resulting in partly distinct pathways for the epigenetic control of gene expression and genomic parasites. In contrast, many unicellular organisms with small nuclear genomes seem to have lost entirely the RNA-silencing machinery or have retained only a basic set of components. We report here that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular eukaryote with a relatively large nuclear genome, has undergone extensive duplication of Dicer and Argonaute polypeptides after the divergence of the green algae and land plant lineages. Chlamydomonas encodes three Dicers and three Argonautes with DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) and ARGONAUTE1 being more divergent than the other paralogs. Interestingly, DCL1 is uniquely involved in the post-transcriptional silencing of retrotransposons such as TOC1. Moreover, on the basis of the subcellular distribution of TOC1 small RNAs and target transcripts, this pathway most likely operates in the nucleus. However, Chlamydomonas also relies on a DCL1-independent, transcriptional silencing mechanism(s) for the maintenance of transposon repression. Our results suggest that multiple, partly redundant epigenetic processes are involved in preventing transposon mobilization in this green alga.",1,0,1,0,0
25689842,2015,"Cells from the coelomic cavity of adult zebrafish (zf) were used to study the alarmin-like activities of nonspecific cytotoxic cell antimicrobial protein-1 (NCAMP-1). Immunohistochemistry studies using polyclonal anti-NCAMP-1 identified constitutive NCAMP-1 in epithelial cells of the zf anterior kidney, in liver parenchyma and in the lamina propria of the intestine. NCAMP-1 was also located in the cytosol of mononuclear cells in these tissues. Cytosolic NCAMP-1 was detected in a diverse population of coelomic cells (CC) using confocal microscopy and polyclonal anti-NCAMP-1 staining. Large mononuclear and heterophil-like CC had intracellular NCAMP-1. These studies indicated that NCAMP-1 is constitutively found in epithelial cells and in ZFCC. To establish a relationship between NCAMP-1 and the alarmin functions of ATP, a stimulation-secretion model was initiated using zf coelomic cells (ZFCC). ZFCCs treated with the alarmin ATP secreted NCAMP-1 into culture supernatants. Treatment of ZFCC with either ATP or NCAMP-1 activated purinergic receptor induced pore formation detected by the ZFCC uptake of the dye YO-PRO-1. ATP induced YO-PRO-1 uptake was inhibited by antagonists oxidized-ATP, KN62, or CBB. These antagonists did not compete with NCAMP-1 induced YO-PRO-1 uptake. Binding of ZFCC by both ATP and NCAMP-1 produced an influx of Ca2+. Combined treatment of ZFCC with ATP and NCAMP-1 increased target cell cytotoxicity. Individually NCAMP-1 or ATP treatment did not produce target cell damage. Similar to ATP, NCAMP-1 activates cellular pore formation, calcium influx and cytotoxicity. ",1,1,2,0,0
9731740,1998,"P-glycoproteins (Pgp) are comprised of a small family of plasma membrane proteins whose abundance in cultured cells is often associated with the multidrug resistance phenotype. Overexpression of Pgp has been observed in many types of human cancers, but the molecular basis for this overexpression has not been established. We have used primary monolayer cultures of adult rat hepatocytes and a stepwise model of rat liver carcinogenesis to study the regulation of Pgp gene expression. We observed a marked overexpression of Pgp, specifically the class II Pgp, in both systems. In addition, we observed that a number of unrelated genes including alpha-tubulin, beta-actin, gamma-actin, cytokeratin 8, cytokeratin 18, and c-myc are overexpressed in cultured hepatocytes, and they are also overexpressed during liver carcinogenesis and in transplantable tumors. Nuclear run-on assays showed no increase in the transcriptional activity of Pgp genes in transplantable liver tumors compared to normal liver. Studies of in vivo mRNA stability, however, revealed that all three Pgp mRNAs were relatively stable in transplantable liver tumors (t(1/2) > 12 h), in contrast to what was found in normal liver (t(1/2) < 2 h). In addition, mRNA for several other genes, including alpha-tubulin, c-myc, and cyclin D1, all appear to be stabilized in the tumors. These findings suggest that the overexpression of Pgp genes in rat liver tumors may be the result of a mechanism involving stabilization of a diverse group of mRNAs.",1,1,2,0,0
9724649,1998,"Basic Krüppel-like factor (BKLF) is a zinc finger protein that recognizes CACCC elements in DNA. It is expressed highly in erythroid tissues, the brain and other selected cell types. We have studied the activity of BKLF and found that it is capable of repressing transcription, and have mapped its repression domain to the N-terminus. We carried out a two-hybrid screen against BKLF and isolated a novel clone encoding murine C-terminal-binding protein 2 (mCtBP2). mCtBP2 is related to human CtBP, a cellular protein which binds to a Pro-X-Asp-Leu-Ser motif in the C-terminus of the adenoviral oncoprotein, E1a. We show that mCtBP2 recognizes a related motif in the minimal repression domain of BKLF, and the integrity of this motif is required for repression activity. Moreover, when tethered to a promoter by a heterologous DNA-binding domain, mCtBP2 functions as a potent repressor. Finally, we demonstrate that mCtBP2 also interacts with the mammalian transcripition factors Evi-1, AREB6, ZEB and FOG. These results establish a new member of the CtBP family, mCtBP2, as a mammalian co-repressor targeting diverse transcriptional regulators.",1,0,1,0,0

15144760,2004,"Medical approaches to sexual difficulties prioritise the physical aspects of sexuality over other aspects, locating 'disorders' primarily in the anatomy, chemistry or physiology of the body. In accordance with this perspective on sexual matters, physicians look to physical interventions (for example, hormones, drugs, and surgery) to treat any 'abnormalities'. Following the discovery of popular--and profitabl-e-sexuopharmaceuticals such as sildenafil citrate (Viagra) for the treatment of erectile difficulties affecting men, the medical model has gained increasing influence in the domain of sexual health and well-being. However, while medical definitions of--and interventions related to--sexual difficulties are underpinned by an understanding of a 'universal' body (that is, an essential biological body that transcends culture and history), and by the categorisation of the normal and the pathological, the accounts of users of Viagra, and their sexual partners, do not necessarily support such understandings. In some cases, the experiences and perspectives of those affected by erectile difficulties directly challenge the reductionist model of sexuality and sexual experience espoused by medicine. In this paper, we report on a New Zealand study investigating the socio-cultural implications of Viagra, involving 33 men and 27 women discussing the impact of erectile difficulties and Viagra use within relationships. The diverse experiences of participants are discussed in relation to two key issues: the notion of 'sexual dysfunction' itself; and the idea of drugs such as Viagra acting as a 'quick fix' for sexual difficulties affecting men. We argue that the existence of a range of Viagra 'stories' disrupts a simplistic mechanistic portrayal of the male body, male sexuality and 'erectile disorder'.",1,1,17,0,1
18664619,2008,"Candidate gene investigations have indicated a significant role for epigenetic events in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. To assess the medulloblastoma epigenome more comprehensively, we undertook a genomewide investigation to identify genes that display evidence of methylation-dependent regulation. Expression microarray analysis of medulloblastoma cell lines following treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor revealed deregulation of multiple transcripts (3%-6% of probes per cell line). Eighteen independent genes demonstrated >3-fold reactivation in all cell lines tested. Bisulfite sequence analysis revealed dense CpG island methylation associated with transcriptional silencing for 12 of these genes. Extension of this analysis to primary tumors and the normal cerebellum revealed three major classes of epigenetically regulated genes: (1) normally methylated genes (DAZL, ZNF157, ASN) whose methylation reflects somatic patterns observed in the cerebellum, (2) X-linked genes (MSN, POU3F4, HTR2C) that show disruption of their sex-specific methylation patterns in tumors, and (3) tumor-specific methylated genes (COL1A2, S100A10, S100A6, HTATIP2, CDH1, LXN) that display enhanced methylation levels in tumors compared with the cerebellum. Detailed analysis of COL1A2 supports a key role in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis; dense biallelic methylation associated with transcriptional silencing was observed in 46 of 60 cases (77%). Moreover, COL1A2 status distinguished infant medulloblastomas of the desmoplastic histopathological subtype, indicating that distinct molecular pathogenesis may underlie these tumors and their more favorable prognosis. These data reveal a more diverse and expansive medulloblastoma epi genome than previously understood and provide strong evidence that the methylation status of specific genes may contribute to the biological subclassification of medulloblastoma.",1,1,4,0,0

16829298,2006,"BACKGROUND:
Molecular typing of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and contact tracing provide a combined approach for analysis of sexual networks in metropolitan areas, although there are some difficulties in application. Our aim was to examine the application of high-throughput molecular approaches that can identify individuals in linked sexual networks.
METHODS:
We characterised 2045 isolates of N gonorrhoeae from patients presenting at 13 major sexually transmitted infection clinics in London, UK, between June 1 and Nov 30, 2004. All isolates were assigned a sequence type (strain) on the basis of the sequences of internal fragments of two highly polymorphic loci, por and tbpB. These types were matched to demographic and behavioural data obtained at the clinic for each patient. We assessed the congruence in the demographic and behavioural characteristics of individuals infected with the same strain.
RESULTS:
We identified 21 prevalent strains in this diverse gonococcal population, each infecting between 20 and 124 individuals. Seven of these strains were predominantly from men who have sex with men; the remaining 14 were predominantly from heterosexual people. No differences were recorded between the strains associated with men who have sex with men in the demographic or behavioural characteristics of infected individuals. By contrast, significant differences in age (p<0.0001), ethnicity (p=0.001), proportion of women (p=0.01), and HIV status (p=0.03) were noted between the 14 prevalent heterosexual-associated strains. Heterosexuals with strains not shared by others in the sample were significantly older (p=0.0005) and more likely to have had sex outside the UK (p<0.0001) than those sharing a strain with at least one other.
CONCLUSIONS:
The discriminatory high throughput strain characterisation method applied here identified localised transmission networks and suggests little bridging between networks of men who have sex with men and heterosexual networks.

Metastasised neuroblastoma is a largely incurable neoplasia in children over one year of age using current treatment protocols. After dissemination to the bone, the survival rate is <7%, indicating an urgent need for novel therapeutic regimes. As curcumin (diferuloylmethane) had been shown to exert strong anticancer effects against diverse human malignancies different from neurblastoma, the antiproliferative effect of curcumin on the growth of human neuroblastoma cell lines was tested.
METHODS:
Proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines Lan-5, SK-N-SH and Kelly under the treatment of curcumin over a broad concentration range (1 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(2) microM) was assessed using XTT cell proliferation assays. Possible induction of apoptosis through curcumin treatment was assessed by detection of DNA fragmentation. To investigate the effect of curcumin on NFkappaB activation, the protein levels of the NFkappaB subunit p65 of curcumin-treated cells were compared to untreated cells using Western blots.
RESULTS:
Curcumin showed a significant dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on all three neuroblastoma cell lines starting at a concentration of 1 x 10(-3) microM. The highest concentration of 1 x 10(2) microM significantly reduced the viable cell count to 8-48% depending on the cell line. This antiproliferative effect was mediated through an increased induction of apoptosis by inhibition of NFkappaB, corroborating earlier findings indicating an antiapoptotic effect of NFkappaB.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our results suggest that curcumin might hold promise in the treatment of patients suffering from neuroblastoma.

The same set of variables is also strongly correlated with spatial changes in species compositions of bivalves, a major component of the benthic marine biota, at the 1° grid-cell resolution.

27806978,2016,"BACKGROUND:
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has recommended that nutritional management of the preterm infant should aim to achieve body composition that replicates the in utero fetus, but intrauterine body composition reference charts for preterm infants are lacking.
OBJECTIVE:
Our objective was to create body composition reference curves for preterm infants that approximate the body composition of the in utero fetus from 30 to 36 wk of gestation.
DESIGN:
A total of 223 ethnically diverse infants born at 30 + 0 to 36 + 6 wk of gestation were enrolled. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified so that the sample would represent healthy appropriately growing fetuses (e.g., singleton, birth weight appropriate for their gestational age, and medically stable). Cross-sectional reference values were generated for fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and percentage body fat (PBF) by gestational age (GA), with the use of air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) and the lambda-mu-sigma method for percentile estimation.
RESULTS:
GA-specific percentile values and a percentile and z score calculator for FFM, FM, and PBF are presented. These values aligned closely with ADP centile values published for term infants from 36 to 38 wk of gestation. The medians were also similar to the mean values for the reference fetus derived from chemical analysis previously.
CONCLUSIONS:
To our knowledge, these are the first body composition reference charts for total FM and FFM at birth in preterm infants to assist in following AAP guidelines. Future work will test the clinical utility of body composition monitoring for improving nutritional management in this population. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02855814.

30731000,2019,"We present a questionnaire-based measure of four animal ethics orientations. The orientations, which were developed in light of existing empirical studies of attitudes to animal use and ethical theory, are: animal rights, anthropocentrism, lay utilitarianism, and animal protection. The two latter orientations can be viewed as variants of animal welfarism. Three studies were conducted in Denmark in order to identify the hypothesised orientations, evaluate their concurrent validity, and report their prevalence and relevance in animal-related opinion formation and behaviour. Explorative factor analysis (Study 1) and confirmative factor analysis (Study 2) successfully identified the four orientations. Study 2 revealed good measurement invariance, as there was none or very modest differential item functioning across age, gender, living area, and contrasting population segments. Evaluation of concurrent validity in Study 2 found that the orientations are associated with different kinds of behaviour and opinion when the human use of animals is involved in the hypothesised directions. In Study 3, a representative population study, the animal protection orientation proved to be most prevalent in the Danish population, and as in study 2 the four orientations were associated with different behaviours and opinions. Remarkably, the animal protection orientation does not lead to increased animal welfare-friendly meat consumption, the main reason for this being non-concern about the current welfare status of farm animals. We argue that the developed measure covers a wide range of diversity in animal ethics orientations that is likely to exist in a modern society such as Denmark and can be used in future studies to track changes in the orientations and to understand and test hypotheses about the sources and justifications of people's animal-related opinions and behaviours.",1,1,3,0,3

Perhaps because these links have been demonstrated in other species, it has been suggested that walking is important to elephant welfare, and that zoo elephant exhibits should be designed to allow for more walking. Our study is the first to address this suggestion empirically by measuring the mean daily walking distance of elephants in North American zoos, determining the factors that are associated with variations in walking distance, and testing for associations between walking and welfare indicators. We used anklets equipped with GPS data loggers to measure outdoor daily walking distance in 56 adult female African (n = 33) and Asian (n = 23) elephants housed in 30 North American zoos. We collected 259 days of data and determined associations between distance walked and social, housing, management, and demographic factors. Elephants walked an average of 5.3 km/day with no significant difference between species. In our multivariable model, more diverse feeding regimens were correlated with increased walking, and elephants who were fed on a temporally unpredictable feeding schedule walked 1.29 km/day more than elephants fed on a predictable schedule. Distance walked was also positively correlated with an increase in the number of social groupings and negatively correlated with age. We found a small but significant negative correlation between distance walked and nighttime Space Experience, but no other associations between walking distances and exhibit size were found. Finally, distance walked was not related to health or behavioral outcomes including foot health, joint health, body condition, and the performance of stereotypic behavior, suggesting that more research is necessary to determine explicitly how differences in walking may impact elephant welfare.

22633806,2012,"Although human perception of food flavors involves integration of multiple sensory inputs, the most salient sensations are taste and olfaction. Ortho- and retronasal olfaction are particularly crucial to flavor because they provide the qualitative diversity so important to identify safe versus dangerous foods. Historically, flavor research has prioritized aroma volatiles present at levels exceeding the orthonasally measured odor threshold, ignoring the variation in the rate at which odor intensities grow above threshold. Furthermore, the chemical composition of a food in itself tells us very little about whether or not that food will be liked. Clearly, alternative approaches are needed to elucidate flavor chemistry. Here we use targeted metabolomics and natural variation in flavor-associated sugars, acids, and aroma volatiles to evaluate the chemistry of tomato fruits, creating a predictive and testable model of liking. This nontraditional approach provides novel insights into flavor chemistry, the interactions between taste and retronasal olfaction, and a paradigm for enhancing liking of natural products.

The Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were significantly higher in the two-year and three-year monoculture soils than in the newly planted soil. Consecutive monoculture of this plant led to a significant increase in relative abundance of Fusarium, Trichocladium and Myrothecium and Simplicillium, etc., but a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Penicillium. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed a significant increase in Fusarium oxysporum, an agent known to cause wilt and rot disease of P. heterophylla. Furthermore, phenolic acid mixture at a ratio similar to that found in the rhizosphere could promote mycelial growth of pathogenic F. oxysporum. Overall, this study demonstrated that consecutive monoculture of P. heterophylla can alter the fungal community in the rhizosphere, including enrichment of host-specific pathogenic fungi at the expense of plant-beneficial fungi.",1,0,1,0,0
24204314,2013,"Intellectual Disability (ID) disorders, defined by an IQ below 70, are genetically and phenotypically highly heterogeneous. Identification of common molecular pathways underlying these disorders is crucial for understanding the molecular basis of cognition and for the development of therapeutic intervention strategies. To systematically establish their functional connectivity, we used transgenic RNAi to target 270 ID gene orthologs in the Drosophila eye. Assessment of neuronal function in behavioral and electrophysiological assays and multiparametric morphological analysis identified phenotypes associated with knockdown of 180 ID gene orthologs. Most of these genotype-phenotype associations were novel. For example, we uncovered 16 genes that are required for basal neurotransmission and have not previously been implicated in this process in any system or organism. ID gene orthologs with morphological eye phenotypes, in contrast to genes without phenotypes, are relatively highly expressed in the human nervous system and are enriched for neuronal functions, suggesting that eye phenotyping can distinguish different classes of ID genes. Indeed, grouping genes by Drosophila phenotype uncovered 26 connected functional modules. Novel links between ID genes successfully predicted that MYCN, PIGV and UPF3B regulate synapse development. Drosophila phenotype groups show, in addition to ID, significant phenotypic similarity also in humans, indicating that functional modules are conserved. The combined data indicate that ID disorders, despite their extreme genetic diversity, are caused by disruption of a limited number of highly connected functional modules. ",1,1,2,0,0

31421072,2019,"Prostate cancer (PC) is a leading cause of death in men. Inflammation is one of the initiating processes whereby cells are trafficked into the tumor microenvironment by specific cytokines termed chemokines. This recruitment is complex and involves diverse leukocyte subsets with procancer and anticancer functions. Chemokines promote/abrogate proliferation of cancerous cells, block/aid apoptosis, and are instrumental/detrimental in cancer cell migration required for metastasis. Chemokines guide the release/transport of immune cells that serve as chaperones at sites of inflammation, and after subsequent activation, they lead to an immune response. The variety of immune cells recruited at the site of tumor initiation possess unique functions, and the plethora of chemokines released by each cell derived from a progenitor cell activated under a defined set of conditions dictates its specific role in cancer progression/regression. Geographic consequences that govern the climate and endemic diseases, along with the associated evolutionary effects that at times protect populations from one disease, could lead to genetic variations that determine a role for ethnicity and race in PC risk and susceptibility. Dysregulated expression or an imbalance in the homeostatic mechanisms associated with chemokines is implicated in PC. This review discusses the role of inflammation and chemokines in PC.",1,1,4,2,2

The purpose of this study was to compare the demographic characteristics and sexual risk behaviors of women who seek emergency contraception (EC) and general family planning (FP) services.
METHODS:
This cross-sectional study included 227 women aged 17-43 years who were being evaluated for either EC or FP in an outpatient setting from 2003-2004. Descriptive statistics and odds ratios were included.
RESULTS:
The EC group, compared with the FP group, had higher proportions of women with education beyond high school (62% vs 52%; P = .02), and not married (79% vs 42%; P < .01). The groups also differed by age, race, and income. The EC group was more likely to have been unprotected at their last intercourse (odds ratio, 5.56; 95% CI, 2.22, 14.29) and less likely to have a previous sexually transmitted infection (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17, 0.96).

The development of EC education programs for women is important for increasing awareness for diverse groups of women and their healthcare providers.

The RP2 gene encodes a protein with homology to cofactor C, a tubulin-folding chaperone. By searching protein sequence databases, we identified a whole set of similar molecules from diverse organisms. Protein sequence alignments show that RP2 and cofactor C represent members of two distinct orthologous groups. All previously identified missense mutations affect amino acid residues which are conserved in all RP2 orthologues or both orthologous groups. Intracellular localization of the wild-type protein and mutated variants was determined by fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing RP2 with a green fluorescent protein tag. A mutation in the N-terminus of RP2 abolishes localization to the plasma membrane in HeLa cells. C-terminal protein truncation mutations, which account for 2/3 of the pathogenic RP2 variants, lead to scattered fluorescent foci in the cytoplasm of COS-7 and HeLa cells. Analysis of protein extracts from the respective cells with anti-RP2 antibodies identified truncated proteins of expected size in a low-speed centrifugation pellet while the wild-type protein appeared in the supernatant. Moreover, no protein was detected in immortalized cell lines from patients with protein truncation mutations while mRNA was still present. Thus, loss of the protein and/or aberrant intracellular distribution might be the basis for the photoreceptor cell degeneration in most RP2 cases.",1,1,2,0,0

20613724,2010,"The insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway has diverse roles from metabolism to longevity. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the single forkhead box O (FOXO) homologue, DAF-16, functions as the major target of the IIS pathway. One of two isoforms, DAF-16a, is known to regulate longevity, stress response and dauer diapause. However, it remains unclear how DAF-16 achieves its specificity in regulating these various biological processes. Here we identify a new isoform, DAF-16d/f, as an important isoform regulating longevity. We show that DAF-16 isoforms functionally cooperate to modulate IIS-mediated processes through differential tissue enrichment, preferential modulation by upstream kinases, and regulating distinct and overlapping target genes. Promoter-swapping experiments show both the promoter and the coding region of DAF-16 are important for its function. Importantly, in mammals, four FOXO genes have overlapping and different functions, and in C. elegans, a single FOXO/DAF-16 uses distinct isoforms to fine-tune the IIS-mediated processes in the context of a whole organism.",1,0,1,0,0
12442231,2002,"Direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms requires sample homozygosity. For the indel polymorphisms that have the deletion allele with a relatively low frequency in the autosomal regions, direct PCR detection becomes difficult or impossible. The present study is, to our knowledge, the first designed to directly detect indel polymorphisms in a human autosomal region (i.e., the immunoglobulin V(H) region), through use of single haploid sperm cells as subjects. Unique marker sequences (n=32), spaced at approximately 5-kb intervals, were selected near the 3' end of the V(H) region. A two-round multiplex PCR protocol was used to amplify these sequences from single sperm samples from nine unrelated healthy donors. The parental haplotypes of the donors were determined by examining the presence or absence of these markers. Seven clustered markers in 6 of the 18 haplotypes were missing and likely represented a 35-40-kb indel polymorphism. The genotypes of the donors, with respect to this polymorphism, perfectly matched the expectation under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Three V(H) gene segments, of which two are functional, are affected by this polymorphism. According to these results, >10% of individuals in the human population may not have these gene segments in their genome, and approximately 44% may have only one copy of these gene segments. The biological impact of this polymorphism would be very interesting to study. The approach used in the present study could be applied to understand the physical structure and diversity of all other autosomal regions.",1,0,1,0,0
26523374,2015,"BACKGROUND:
This study investigated the relationships between background intestinal uptake on 18F-FDG PET and cardio-metabolic risk (CMR) factors.
METHODS:
A total of 326 female patients that underwent 18F-FDG PET to determine the initial stage of breast cancer were enrolled. None of the patients had history of diabetes or hypertension. The background intestinal uptake on PET was visually graded (low vs. high uptake group) and quantitatively measured using the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax). SUVmax of 7 bowel segments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, splenic flexure, and descending colon-sigmoid junction) were averaged for the total bowel (TB SUVmax). Age, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose level (BST), triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were the considered CMR factors. The relationships between background intestinal 18F-FDG uptake on PET and diverse CMR factors were analyzed.
RESULTS:
The visual grades based on background intestinal 18F-FDG uptake classified 100 (30.7%) patients into the low uptake group, while 226 (69.3%) were classified into the high uptake group. Among CMR factors, age (p = 0.004), BMI (p<0.001), and TG (p<0.001) were significantly different according to visual grade of background intestinal 18F-FDG uptake. Quantitative TB SUVmax showed significant positive correlation with age (r = 0.203, p<0.001), BMI (r = 0.373, p<0.001), TG (r = 0.338, p<0.001), cholesterol (r = 0.148, p = 0.008), and LDL (r = 0.143, p = 0.024) and significant negative correlation with HDL (r = -0.147, p = 0.022). Multivariate analysis indicated that BMI and TG were independent factors in both visually graded background intestinal 18F-FDG uptake (p = 0.027 and p = 0.023, respectively) and quantitatively measured TB SUVmax (p = 0.006 and p = 0.004, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS:
Increased background intestinal 18F-FDG uptake on PET may suggest alteration of lipid metabolism and risk of cardio-metabolic disease in non-diabetic and non-hypertensive breast cancer patients.

23667606,2013,"Caveolae are plasma membrane structures formed from a complex of the proteins caveolin-1 and caveolin-2. Caveolae interact with pro-inflammatory cytokines and are dysregulated in fibrotic disease. Although caveolae are present infrequently in healthy kidneys, they are abundant during kidney injury. An association has been identified between a CAV1 gene variant and long term kidney transplant survival. Chronic, gradual decline in transplant function is a persistent problem in kidney transplantation. The aetiology of this is diverse but fibrosis within the transplanted organ is the common end point. This study is the first to investigate the association of CAV2 gene variants with kidney transplant outcomes. Genomic DNA from donors and recipients of 575 kidney transplants performed in Belfast was investigated for common variation in CAV2 using a tag SNP approach. The CAV2 SNP rs13221869 was nominally significant for kidney transplant failure. Validation was sought in an independent group of kidney transplant donors and recipients from Dublin, Ireland using a second genotyping technology. Due to the unexpected absence of rs13221869 from this cohort, the CAV2 gene was resequenced. One novel SNP and a novel insertion/deletion in CAV2 were identified; rs13221869 is located in a repetitive region and was not a true variant in resequenced populations. CAV2 is a plausible candidate gene for association with kidney transplant outcomes given its proximity to CAV1 and its role in attenuating fibrosis. This study does not support an association between CAV2 variation and kidney transplant survival. Further analysis of CAV2 should be undertaken with an awareness of the sequence complexities and genetic variants highlighted by this study.",1,0,1,0,1

In this review, we will explore the role of other members of the TNF/TNF receptor superfamily (TNFSF/TNFRSF) in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) focusing on TWEAK and its receptor Fn14, new players in myocardial remodeling and heart failure. The TWEAK/Fn14 pathway controls a variety of cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and has diverse biological functions in pathological mechanisms like inflammation and fibrosis that are associated with CVDs. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the TWEAK/Fn14 axis is a positive regulator of cardiac hypertrophy and that deletion of Fn14 receptor protects from right heart fibrosis and dysfunction. We discuss the potential use of the TWEAK/Fn14 axis as biomarker for CVDs as well as therapeutic target for future treatment of human heart failure based on supporting data from animal models and in vitro studies.

Immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses showed an intra-alveolar accumulation of surfactant protein (SP)-A, precursors of SP-B, mature SP-B, aberrantly processed proSP-C, as well as mono- and dimeric SP-C. Sequencing of genomic DNA detected a de novo heterozygous missense mutation of the SFTPC gene (g.1286T>C) resulting in a substitution of threonine for isoleucine (173T) in the C-terminal propeptide.

However, this scheme possesses critical vulnerabilities. First, the scheme cannot prevent off-line password guessing attacks and server spoofing attack, and cannot preserve user identity. Second, there is no password verification process with the failure to identify the correct password at the beginning of the login phase. Third, the mechanism of password change is incompetent, in that it induces inefficient communication in communicating with the server to change a user password.

19922971,2009,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly. The RSV fusion (F) protein mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the target cell membrane during virus entry and is a primary target for antiviral drug and vaccine development. The F protein contains two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2. Peptides corresponding to these regions form a six-helix bundle structure that is thought to play a critical role in membrane fusion. However, characterization of six-helix bundle formation in native RSV F protein has been hindered by the fact that a trigger for F protein conformational change has yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that RSV F protein on the surface of infected cells undergoes a conformational change following exposure to elevated temperature, resulting in the formation of the six-helix bundle structure. We first generated and characterized six-helix bundle-specific antibodies raised against recombinant peptides modeling the RSV F protein six-helix bundle structure. We then used these antibodies as probes to monitor RSV F protein six-helix bundle formation in response to a diverse array of potential triggers of conformational changes. We found that exposure of 'membrane-anchored' RSV F protein to elevated temperature (45-55 degrees C) was sufficient to trigger six-helix bundle formation. Antibody binding to the six-helix bundle conformation was detected by both flow cytometry and cell-surface immunoprecipitation of the RSV F protein. None of the other treatments, including interaction with a number of potential receptors, resulted in significant binding by six-helix bundle-specific antibodies. We conclude that native, untriggered RSV F protein exists in a metastable state that can be converted in vitro to the more stable, fusogenic six-helix bundle conformation by an increase in thermal energy. These findings help to better define the mechanism of RSV F-mediated membrane fusion and have important implications for the identification of therapeutic strategies and vaccines targeting RSV F protein conformational changes.",1,1,2,0,0
31203753,2019,"Global warming appears to favour smaller-bodied organisms, but whether larger species are also more vulnerable to thermal extremes, as suggested for past mass-extinction events, is still an open question. Here, we tested whether interspecific differences in thermal tolerance (heat and cold) of ectotherm organisms are linked to differences in their body mass and genome size (as a proxy for cell size). Since the vulnerability of larger, aquatic taxa to warming has been attributed to the oxygen limitation hypothesis, we also assessed how body mass and genome size modulate thermal tolerance in species with contrasting breathing modes, habitats and life stages. A database with the upper (CTmax) and lower (CTmin) critical thermal limits and their methodological aspects was assembled comprising more than 500 species of ectotherms. Our results demonstrate that thermal tolerance in ectotherms is dependent on body mass and genome size and these relationships became especially evident in prolonged experimental trials where energy efficiency gains importance. During long-term trials, CTmax was impaired in larger-bodied water-breathers, consistent with a role for oxygen limitation. Variation in CTmin was mostly explained by the combined effects of body mass and genome size and it was enhanced in larger-celled, air-breathing species during long-term trials, consistent with a role for depolarization of cell membranes. Our results also highlight the importance of accounting for phylogeny and exposure duration. Especially when considering long-term trials, the observed effects on thermal limits are more in line with the warming-induced reduction in body mass observed during long-term rearing experiments.

25192596,2014,"BACKGROUND:
Production of D-xylonate by the yeast S. cerevisiae provides an example of bioprocess development for sustainable production of value-added chemicals from cheap raw materials or side streams. Production of D-xylonate may lead to considerable intracellular accumulation of D-xylonate and to loss of viability during the production process. In order to understand the physiological responses associated with D-xylonate production, we performed transcriptome analyses during D-xylonate production by a robust recombinant strain of S. cerevisiae which produces up to 50 g/L D-xylonate.
RESULTS:
Comparison of the transcriptomes of the D-xylonate producing and the control strain showed considerably higher expression of the genes controlled by the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway and of some genes previously identified as up-regulated in response to other organic acids in the D-xylonate producing strain. Increased phosphorylation of Slt2 kinase in the D-xylonate producing strain also indicated that D-xylonate production caused stress to the cell wall. Surprisingly, genes encoding proteins involved in translation, ribosome structure and RNA metabolism, processes which are commonly down-regulated under conditions causing cellular stress, were up-regulated during D-xylonate production, compared to the control. The overall transcriptional responses were, therefore, very dissimilar to those previously reported as being associated with stress, including stress induced by organic acid treatment or production. Quantitative PCR analyses of selected genes supported the observations made in the transcriptomic analysis. In addition, consumption of ethanol was slower and the level of trehalose was lower in the D-xylonate producing strain, compared to the control.
CONCLUSIONS:
The production of organic acids has a major impact on the physiology of yeast cells, but the transcriptional responses to presence or production of different acids differs considerably, being much more diverse than responses to other stresses. D-Xylonate production apparently imposed considerable stress on the cell wall. Transcriptional data also indicated that activation of the PKA pathway occurred during D-xylonate production, leaving cells unable to adapt normally to stationary phase. This, together with intracellular acidification, probably contributes to cell death.

23936399,2013,"OBJECTIVE:
There is an emerging evidence base for the use of music therapy in the treatment of severe mental illness. Whilst different models of music therapy have been developed in mental health care, none have specifically accounted for the features and context of acute in-patient settings. This review aimed to identify how music therapy is provided for acute adult psychiatric in-patients and what outcomes have been reported.
METHODS:
A systematic review using medical, psychological and music therapy databases. Papers describing music therapy with acute adult psychiatric in-patients were included. Analysis utilised narrative synthesis.
RESULTS:
98 papers were identified, of which 35 reported research findings. Open group work and active music making for nonverbal expression alongside verbal reflection was emphasised. Aims were engagement, communication and interpersonal relationships focusing upon immediate areas of need rather than longer term insight. The short stay, patient diversity and institutional structure influenced delivery and resulted in a focus on single sessions, high session frequency, more therapist direction, flexible use of musical activities, predictable musical structures, and clear realistic goals. Outcome studies suggested effectiveness in addressing a range of symptoms, but were limited by methodological shortcomings and small sample sizes. Studies with significant positive effects all used active musical participation with a degree of structure and were delivered in four or more sessions.
CONCLUSIONS:
No single clearly defined model exists for music therapy with adults in acute psychiatric in-patient settings, and described models are not conclusive. Greater frequency of therapy, active structured music making with verbal discussion, consistency of contact and boundaries, an emphasis on building a therapeutic relationship and building patient resources may be of particular importance. Further research is required to develop specific music therapy models for this patient group that can be tested in experimental studies.

Studies of alpha 1-PI and other serine protease inhibitor genes have revealed an unusually high rate of mutation of the reactive centers of the inhibitors. Using a modification of the PCR technique, we have previously identified five distinct alpha 1 PI reactive site sequences present in the genome of C57BL/6 mice. In this report, we use cDNA cloning techniques to demonstrate that all five genes are expressed in the adult mouse liver. DNA sequence analysis shows that three of the five mRNAs expressed have a substitution for methionine-353, which is essential for normal activity of the homologous human protein, alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT). Comparison of the DNA sequences of the five cDNAs indicates a higher degree of polymorphism in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein and an extraordinarily replacement/silent ratio of nucleotide changes in a narrow region surrounding the reactive site. The clustering of polymorphisms near the reactive site combined with the high replacement/silent ratio suggest an evolutionary mechanism that apparently selects for functional diversity of the alpha 1-PI genes. Finally, modeling of the three-dimensional positions of the alpha 1-PI polymorphic residues into the homologous positions of the crystallographic structure of ovalbumin, a member of the alpha 1-PI supergene family, predicts that many of these amino acids are on the surfaces, which are likely to interact with the protease targets.",1,1,2,0,0
24086426,2013,"Hunting is one of the main driving forces behind large mammal density distribution in many regions of the world. In tropical Africa, urban demand for bushmeat has been shown to dominate over subsistence hunting and its impact often overrides spatial-ecological species characteristics. To effectively protect remaining mammal populations the main factors that influence their distribution need to be integrated into conservation area prioritisation and management plans. This information has been lacking for Río Muni, Equatorial Guinea, as prior studies have been outdated or have not systematically covered the continental region of the country. In this study we evaluated: 1) the relative importance of local vs. commercial hunting; 2) wildlife density of protected vs. non-protected areas; and 3) the importance of ecological factors vs. human influence in driving mammal density distribution in Río Muni. We adopted a systematic countrywide line transect approach with particular focus on apes and elephants, but also including other mammal species. For analysis of field data we used generalised linear models with a set of predictor variables representing ecological conditions, anthropogenic pressure and protected areas. We estimate that there are currently 884 (437-1,789) elephants and 11,097 (8,719-13,592) chimpanzees and gorillas remaining in Río Muni. The results indicate strong hunting pressures on both local and commercial levels, with roads demonstrating a negative impact on elephants and overall mammal body mass. Protected areas played no role in determining any of the mammal species distributions and significant human hunting signs were found inside these protected areas, illustrating the lack of environmental law enforcement throughout the country. Río Muni is currently under-represented in conservation efforts in Western Equatorial Africa, and we recommend a focus on cross-boundary conservation, in particular in the Monte Alén-Monts de Cristal and Río Campo Ma'an conservation landscapes, where the highest densities and diversity of large mammals remain.

Thus, Tri r 2 provides a model for comparing the T cell repertoire in subjects with distinct immune responses to a single Ag. Recombinant Tri r 2 produced as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli stimulated strong in vitro lymphoproliferative responses in 10 IH and 10 DTH responders. Patterns of T cell epitope recognition were compared between skin test groups using 28 overlapping peptides (each in 12 replicate wells) derived from Tri r 2 to stimulate T lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. Peptide 5 (P5; aa 41-60) induced the strongest response in DTH subjects and showed the largest difference between DTH and IH responders in proliferation (mean standardized index, 2.22 and 0.82, respectively; p = 0.0047) and number of positive wells (81 vs 12). Responses to P5 were associated with diverse HLA haplotypes. These results showed that P5 contains an immunodominant epitope specifically associated with DTH and that this peptide is recognized in a permissive manner. Cross-validated linear discriminant analysis using T cell proliferative responses to two regions of Tri r 2 (aa 51-90 and 231-270) gave a 95% predictive accuracy for classification of subjects into IH or DTH groups.

We sought to study the occurrence of cardiometabolic risk variables, their clustering, and their association with insulin resistance among healthy adolescents in urban south India.
METHODS:
School children aged 12-19 years (n = 2,640; 1,323 boys and 1,317 girls) from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds were studied. Demographic, social, and medical details were obtained; anthropometry and blood pressure were measured. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and lipid profiles were measured. Clusters of risk variables were identified by factor analysis. Association of insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment) with individual risk variables and their clusters were assessed.
RESULTS:
One or more cardiometabolic abnormalities (i.e., low HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, or blood pressure) was present in 67.7% of children (in 64.8% of normal weight and 85% of overweight children). Insulin resistance was associated with the above abnormalities except HDL cholesterol. It also showed significant positive association with BMI, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and total cholesterol (P < 0.0001). Factor analysis identified three distinct clusters, with minor differences in the sexes: 1) waist circumference and blood pressure; 2) dyslipidemia, waist circumference, and insulin; and 3) waist circumference, glucose, and plasma insulin, with minor differences in the sexes. Insulin was a component of the lipid and glucometabolic cluster. In girls, it was a component of all three clusters.
CONCLUSIONS:
Cardiometabolic abnormalities are present in nearly 68% of young, healthy, Asian-Indian adolescents and even among those with normal weight. Insulin resistance is associated with individual cardiometabolic factors, and plasma insulin showed association with clustering of some variables.

22096509,2011,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a complex process involving multiple pathways downstream of the primary genetic insult leading to fatal muscle degeneration. Aging muscle is a multifactorial neuromuscular process characterized by impaired muscle regeneration leading to progressive atrophy. We hypothesized that these chronic atrophying situations may share specific myogenic adaptative responses at transcriptional level according to tissue remodeling. Muscle biopsies from four young DMD and four AGED subjects were referred to a group of seven muscle biopsies from young subjects without any neuromuscular disorder and explored through a dedicated expression microarray. We identified 528 differentially expressed genes (out of 2,745 analyzed), of which 328 could be validated by an exhaustive meta-analysis of public microarray datasets referring to DMD and Aging in skeletal muscle. Among the 328 validated co-expressed genes, 50% had the same expression profile in both groups and corresponded to immune/fibrosis responses and mitochondrial metabolism. Generalizing these observed meta-signatures with large compendia of public datasets reinforced our results as they could be also identified in other pathological processes and in diverse physiological conditions. Focusing on the common gene signatures in these two atrophying conditions, we observed enrichment in motifs for candidate transcription factors that may coordinate either the immune/fibrosis responses (ETS1, IRF1, NF1) or the mitochondrial metabolism (ESRRA). Deregulation in their expression could be responsible, at least in part, for the same transcriptome changes initiating the chronic muscle atrophy. This study suggests that distinct pathophysiological processes may share common gene responses and pathways related to specific transcription factors.",1,1,5,0,0

30890138,2019,"BACKGROUND:
Swainsonine is a natural indolizidine alkaloid, its anti-tumor activity has been widely reported in varied cancers. This study aimed to investigate whether Swainsonine exerted anti-tumor impact on glioma cells, likewise uncovered the relative molecular mechanisms.
METHODS:
After administration with diverse concentrations of Swainsonine, cell growth, migration and invasion in U251 and LN444 cells were appraised by the common-used CCK-8, BrdU, flow cytometry and Transwell assays. MiR-92a mimic, inhibitor and the correlative NC were transfected into U251 and LN444 cells, and assessment of miR-92a expression was by utilizing qRT-PCR. Functions of miR-92a in above-mentioned cell biological processes were analyzed again in Swainsonine-treated cells. The momentous proteins of cell cycle, apoptosis and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were ultimately examined by western blot.
RESULTS:
Swainsonine significantly hindered cell proliferation through decreasing cell viability, declining the percentage of BrdU cells, down-regulating CyclinD1 and up-regulating p16 expression. Enhancement of percentage of apoptotic cells was presented in Swainsonine-treated cells via activating cleaved-Caspase-3 and cleaved-Caspase-9. Additionally, Swainsonine impeded the abilities of migration and invasion by decreasing MMP-2, MMP-9, Vimentin and E-cadherin. Repression of miR-92a was observed in Swainsonine-treated cells, and miR-92a overexpression overturned the anti-tumor activity of Swainsonine in glioma cells. Finally, western blot assay displayed that Swainsonine hindered PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway via regulating miR-92a.
CONCLUSIONS:
These discoveries corroborated that Swainsonine exerted anti-tumor impacts on glioma cells via repression of miR-92a, and inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

32443493,2020,"The term ""equity"" (EQUI) is a complex concept to be defined, because it depends on many factors, mainly political ideals. The objective of this research is to determine the evolution and development of the term equity in education by the scientific community. The main objective is to identify the scientific production and performance of the term equity in the field of education. The research method developed is based on bibliometrics, specifically on the technique of scientific mapping, and a process of quantification, analysis, evaluation and estimation of scientific documents was developed. The results indicate there is no established line of research or strong connections between the themes. This shows the existing variety of research on the term equity. Thus, the trend in research on the term equity is focused on the early periods of study on the students' diversity in order to evolve to more concrete and specific aspects of equity, such as gender and race. It is concluded that the theoretical framework of reference shows how equity should be incorporated into the education system under the parameters of equal opportunities, of equality in access to higher education, regardless of gender or socio-cultural background.",1,1,13,1,1
28245806,2017,"BACKGROUND:
Teenagers under 18 years old in Vietnam are considered as minors who usually lack the autonomy to make decisions. They are also sometimes viewed as contributors to social evils including crime, violence and substance use. Moreover, most Vietnamese teenagers have unsafe sex before marriage. The objective of this study is to explore the parental perceptions relating to their teenagers' sexuality, particularly the social and cultural forces, that may hinder access to sexuality information.
METHODS:
Guided by a Community Advisory Board (CAB), this qualitative study uses four focus group discussions (FGDs) consisting of 12 mothers and 12 fathers, as well as twelve individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) with a diverse sample of parents of teens in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam. Content and discourse analysis were conducted, based on Foucauldian concepts.
RESULTS:
Four themes emerged: 1) Meanings of sexuality and sexuality education, 2) Early sexual intercourse destroys teenagers' future, 3) Teenagers are not hu hong (spoil/bad thing), are innocent and virgin, and 4) Policing and controlling of sexual intercourse among teens. Parents did not view their teenage children as sexual beings; those who are sexual are considered hu hong. Parents believed that teens need to be policed and controlled to prevent them from becoming hu hong, particularly girls. Controlling of sexuality information by parents was therefore common in HCMC, but differed by gender and educational levels of parents. For example, fathers more than mothers were not comfortable teaching their teenage children about sex and sexuality. Parents with higher education police their teenage children's usage of the Internet and social media, while parents with lower education control who can be friends with their teenage children.
CONCLUSIONS:
Vietnamese parents in general have negative views of sex and sexuality education for their teenage children. Recognizing that many Vietnamese teenagers have unsafe sex before marriage, parents need to change their perceptions and understand the importance of comprehensive sexuality education (CSE), which are included in UNESCO, UNFPA and UNICEF-developed CSE tools.

32690504,2020,"OBJECTIVES:
Musculoskeletal pain is a leading cause of disability globally. In geographically and socioeconomically diverse countries, such as Australia, care seeking when someone experiences musculoskeletal pain is varied and potentially influenced by their individual characteristics, access to practitioners or perceived trustworthiness of information. This study explored how consumers currently access healthcare, how well it is trusted and if sociodemographic factors influenced healthcare utilisation.
DESIGN:
Anonymous online observational survey.
SETTING:
Australia.
PARTICIPANTS:
A convenience sample of 831 community-based individuals (18+ years).
OUTCOME MEASURES:
Descriptive analyses and generalised estimating equations were used to quantify healthcare-seeking behaviours, sources and trust of health information for (A) first-contact practitioners, (B) medical practitioners, and (C) other sources of information.
RESULTS:
Of the 761 respondents, 73% were females, 54% resided in capital cities. 68% of respondents had experienced pain or injury in more than one lower limb joint. Despite this, more than 30% of respondents only sought help when there had not been natural resolution of their pain. Physiotherapists had the highest odds of being seen, asked and trusted for healthcare information. The odds of seeking care from general practitioners were no higher than seeking information from an expert website. Older individuals and women exhibited higher odds of seeking, asking and trusting health information.
CONCLUSION:
Intelligible and trustworthy information must be available for consumers experiencing lower limb pain. Individuals, particularly younger people, are seeking information from multiple, unregulated sources. This suggests that healthcare professionals may need to invest time and resources into improving the trustworthiness and availability of healthcare information to improve healthcare quality.

Here we report a one-step, biocompatible, straightforward and general strategy to prepare tough soft hydrogels in a few tens of seconds under mild conditions. With a multimechanism design, the network structures remarkably improve the mechanical properties of hydrogels and maintain their high toughness in various environments. The broad compatibility of the proposed method with a spectrum of printing technologies makes it suitable for potential applications requiring high-resolution patterns/structures.

There are currently several FLT3 inhibitors that are undergoing clinical investigation. However, the discovery of drug-resistant leukemic blast cells in FLT3 inhibitor-treated AML patients has prompted the search for novel, structurally diverse FLT3 inhibitors that could be alternatively used to circumvent drug resistance. Here, we provide an overview of FLT3 inhibitors under preclinical and clinical investigation, and we discuss mechanisms whereby AML cells develop resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, and the ways in which combination therapy could potentially be utilized to override drug resistance. We discuss how the cross-talk between major downstream signaling pathways, such as PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR, RAS/Raf/MEK/ERK, and Jak/STAT, can be exploited for therapeutic purposes by targeting key signaling molecules with selective inhibitors, such as mTOR inhibitors, HSP90 inhibitors, or farnesyltransferase inhibitors, and identifying those agents with the ability to positively combine with inhibitors of FLT3, such as PKC412 and sunitinib. With the widespread onset of drug resistance associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, due to mechanisms involving development of point mutations or gene amplification of target proteins, the use of a multi-targeted therapeutic approach is of potential clinical benefit.",1,1,2,0,0
28949993,2017,"Calcium binding proteins show stereotypical expression patterns within diverse neuron types across the central nervous system. Here, we provide a characterization of developmental and adult secretagogin-immunolabelled neurons in the zebrafish retina with an emphasis on co-expression of multiple calcium binding proteins. Secretagogin is a recently identified and cloned member of the F-hand family of calcium binding proteins, which labels distinct neuron populations in the retinas of mammalian vertebrates. Both the adult distribution of secretagogin labeled retinal neurons as well as the developmental expression indicative of the stage of neurogenesis during which this calcium binding protein is expressed was quantified. Secretagogin expression was confined to an amacrine interneuron population in the inner nuclear layer, with monostratified neurites in the center of the inner plexiform layer and a relatively regular soma distribution (regularity index > 2.5 across central-peripheral areas). However, only a subpopulation (~60%) co-labeled with gamma-aminobutyric acid as their neurotransmitter, suggesting that possibly two amacrine subtypes are secretagogin immunoreactive. Quantitative co-labeling analysis with other known amacrine subtype markers including the three main calcium binding proteins parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin identifies secretagogin immunoreactive neurons as a distinct neuron population. The highest density of secretagogin cells of ~1800 cells / mm2 remained relatively evenly along the horizontal meridian, whilst the density dropped of to 125 cells / mm2 towards the dorsal and ventral periphery. Thus, secretagogin represents a new amacrine label within the zebrafish retina. The developmental expression suggests a possible role in late stage differentiation. This characterization forms the basis of functional studies assessing how the expression of distinct calcium binding proteins might be regulated to compensate for the loss of one of the others.",1,1,3,0,0
32282911,2020,"BACKGROUND:
Kaposi sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) subtype depends mostly on patient origin. The current study aimed to assess KSHV diversity in a population of men who have sex with men (MSM) living in France.
METHODS:
The study included 264 patients. In 65 MSM, including 57 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men with KS, multicentric Castleman disease, or primary effusion lymphoma and 8 HIV-uninfected men receiving HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), we performed KSHV typing with K1 open reading frame Sanger and KSHV whole-genome sequencing. In 199 other patients, we performed real-time polymerase chain reaction screening for the new variant.
RESULTS:
We found that 51% of KSHV-strains were subtype C (85% C3), and 33% were subtype A. Four patients with severe KSHV disease (2 with visceral KS, 1 with multicentric Castleman disease, and 1 with primary effusion lymphoma) and 1 asymptomatic PrEP user had a new variant resembling the Ugandan subtype F, but with different K1 open reading frame and KSHV whole-genome sequences and a different epidemiological context (MSM vs African population). Its prevalence was 4.5% in Caucasian MSM, and it was absent in other epidemiological groups.
CONCLUSIONS:
Subtype C predominated among MSM living in France. The new F variant was identified in Caucasian MSM and associated with severe KSHV disease, suggesting that subtype F could be split into F1 and F2 variants. Careful screening for this variant may be required in MSM, given the severe clinical presentation of associated diseases.

The photosynthetic bacterium uses the RegB-RegA signal transduction cascade to control a wide variety of oxygen-responding processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, carbon fixation and nitrogen fixation. We demonstrate that a highly conserved cysteine has a role in controlling the activity of the sensor kinase, RegB. In vitro studies indicate that exposure of RegB to oxidizing conditions results in the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond and that disulfide bond formation is metal-dependent, with the metal fulfilling a structural role. Formation of a disulfide bond in vitro is also shown to convert the kinase from an active dimer into an inactive tetramer state. Mutational analysis indicates that a cysteine residue flanked by cationic amino acids is involved in redox sensing in vitro and in vivo. These residues appear to constitute a novel 'redox-box' that is present in sensor kinases from diverse species of bacteria.",1,0,1,0,0

We find one case of metastatic spread to the surgical bed causing local recurrence, and another case of cross-metastatic site seeding combining with dynamic remoulding of subclonal mixtures in response to therapy. By ultra-deep sequencing end-stage blood, we detect both metastatic and primary tumour clones, even years after removal of the prostate. Analysis of mutations associated with metastasis reveals an enrichment of TP53 mutations, and additional sequencing of metastases from 19 patients demonstrates that acquisition of TP53 mutations is linked with the expansion of subclones with metastatic potential which we can detect in the blood.

Wheat blast is caused by a distinct, exceptionally diverse lineage of the fungus causing rice blast disease. Through sequencing a recent field isolate, we report a reference genome that includes seven core chromosomes and mini-chromosome sequences that harbor effector genes normally found on ends of core chromosomes in other strains. No mini-chromosomes were observed in an early field strain, and at least two from another isolate each contain different effector genes and core chromosome end sequences. The mini-chromosome is enriched in transposons occurring most frequently at core chromosome ends. Additionally, transposons in mini-chromosomes lack the characteristic signature for inactivation by repeat-induced point (RIP) mutation genome defenses.

The chemical complexity in circumstellar shells was originally thought to be dominated by the elemental carbon to oxygen ratio. Observations have suggested that envelopes with more carbon than oxygen have a significantly greater abundance of molecules than their oxygen-rich analogues. Here we report observations of molecules in the oxygen-rich shell of the red supergiant star VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa). A variety of unexpected chemical compounds have been identified, including NaCl, PN, HNC and HCO+. From the spectral line profiles, the molecules can be distinguished as arising from three distinct kinematic regions: a spherical outflow, a tightly collimated, blue-shifted expansion, and a directed, red-shifted flow. Certain species (SiO, PN and NaCl) exclusively trace the spherical flow, whereas HNC and sulphur-bearing molecules (amongst others) are selectively created in the two expansions, perhaps arising from shock waves. CO, HCN, CS and HCO+ exist in all three components. Despite the oxygen-rich environment, HCN seems to be as abundant as CO.

The androgen receptor (AR) transcription factor is a master regulator of normal glandular homeostasis in the prostate, as well as growth and survival of prostate cancer cells. Therefore, AR-targeted therapies are effective for improving overall survival of patients with advanced prostate cancer that is incurable by surgery or radiation. However, prostate cancer will inevitably progress on AR-targeted therapies to a castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) phenotype that accounts for virtually all prostate cancer-specific death. mRNA transcript variants of the AR gene are expressed in CRPC cells and can be translated to produce AR variant (AR-V) proteins that function as ligand-independent, constitutively active transcription factors. AR-Vs are able to support growth of CRPC cells by promoting expression of AR target genes that are normally suppressed by AR-targeted therapies. Knowledge of mechanisms that govern expression of AR-Vs is incomplete. Studies have shown genomic rearrangements of the AR gene underlie expression of diverse AR-Vs in certain CRPC tumors, but post-transcriptional processes represent a broader regulatory mechanism for expression of AR-Vs in CRPC.

We analyzed the association of these discrete HLA supertypes with HIV disease progression rates in a population of HIV-infected men. We found that HLA supertypes alone and in combination conferred a strong differential advantage in responding to HIV infection, independent of the contribution of single HLA alleles that associate with progression of the disease.

To reduce the gap between pre-clinical and clinical studies, we have created a novel mouse model that expresses human HLA-DR4, but no endogenous MHC on antigen-presenting cells. Moreover, human B7.1 (CD80) is expressed in the pancreatic islets under the control of the rat insulin promoter. Although this model does not develop diabetes spontaneously, it is susceptible to the induction of type 1 diabetes by challenging mice with overlapping peptides derived from murine proinsulin-2 in adjuvant. Unlike the NOD model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes, but akin to the human condition, this model does not have a gender bias. Furthermore, similar to the human condition, the disease is characterised by a diverse leucocyte infiltration of the pancreatic islets and the formation of anti-proinsulin auto-antibodies.

The 20 loci with the strongest selection signals were characterized in detail. Among the top EHH hits were the NRG3 and NBEA genes, which are involved in the development and functioning of the neural system, the PTPRM gene, which mediates cell-cell interactions and adhesion, and a region on chromosome 4 (chr4:28.7-28.9 Mb) that contained several loci affiliated with different classes of non-coding RNAs (RN7SL101P, MIR4275, MESTP3, and LINC02364).

11992299,2002,"OBJECTIVE:
The relative effectiveness of the diverse approaches used to promote preventive care activities, such as cancer screening and adult immunization, is unknown. Despite many high-quality published studies, practices and policymakers attempting to improve preventive care have little definitive information on which to base decisions. Thus, we quantitatively assessed the relative effectiveness of previously studied approaches for improving adherence to adult immunization and cancer screening guidelines.
METHODS:
MEDLINE, the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Review Group register, previous systematic reviews, and the Medicare Health Care Quality Improvement Project database.
METHODS:
Controlled clinical trials that assessed interventions to increase use of immunizations for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia and screening for colon, breast, and cervical cancer in adults.
METHODS:
Two reviewers independently extracted data on characteristics and outcomes from unmasked articles. Intervention components to increase use of services were classified as reminder, feedback, education, financial incentive, legislative action, organizational change, or mass media campaign.
RESULTS:
Of 552 abstracts and articles, 108 met the inclusion criteria. To assess the effect of intervention components, meta-regression models were developed for immunizations and each cancer screening service by using 81 studies with a usual care or control group. The most potent intervention types involved organizational change (the adjusted odds ratios for increased use of services from organizational change ranged from 2.47 to 17.6). Organizational change interventions included the use of separate clinics devoted to prevention, use of a planned care visit for prevention, or designation of nonphysician staff to do specific prevention activities. The next most effective intervention components were patient financial incentives (adjusted odds ratios, 1.82 to 3.42) and patient reminders (adjusted odds ratios, 1.74 to 2.75); the adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.29 to 1.53 for patient education and from 1.10 to 1.76 for feedback.
CONCLUSIONS:
Rates of adult immunization and cancer screening are most likely to improve when a health care organization supports performance of these activities through organizational changes in staffing and clinical procedures. Involving patients in self-management through patient financial incentives and reminders is also likely to positively affect performance.

Normal differentiation of thymic MECs requires LTbetaR ligand on thymocytes and LTbetaR together with nuclear factor-kappaB-inducing kinase (Nik) in thymic epithelial cells.

High salinity and drought are two major abiotic hazards that are destroying the crop world-wide. As a result, Through-out genome 14 unique stress responsive transcription factors of ZFP-genes with varying level of methylation and expression under two conditions (control vs. stress) were isolated. All the identified genes were confirmed from different databases for their specific structure, cis-regulatory elements, phylogenetic analysis, and synteny analysis. Moreover, the tissue-specific expression patterns, and expression under abiotic and phytohormones stresses were also investigated. Phylogenetically all the genes were divided into 6 distinct subgroups with Arabidopsis and orthologous proteins were find-out through synteny analysis. Available RNA-seq data in response to various phytohormones provided hormone inducible gene expression profile. Through Reverse Transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) analysis tissue-specific expression in shoot and root over various time points against salt and osmotic stresses exhibited the diverse expression patterns of identified genes. Overall, the present study providing a foundation for in-depth characterization of identified genes and to further understand the epigenetic role of DNA methylation for genes expression and environmental stresses regulation in higher plant.",1,0,1,0,0
27518822,2016,"Astringency perception, as an essential parameter for high-quality red wine, is principally elicited by condensed tannins in diversified chemical structures. Condensed tannins, which are also known as proanthocyanidins (PAs), belong to the flavonoid class of polyphenols and are incorporated by multiple flavan-3-ols units according to their degree of polymerization (DP). However, the influence of DP size of PAs on astringency perception remains unclear for decades. This controversy was mainly attributed to the lack of efficient strategies to isolate the PAs in non-galloylated forms and with individual degree size from grape/wine. In the present study, the astringency intensity of purified and identified grape oligomeric tannins (DP ranged from 1 to 5) was firstly explored. A novel non-solid phase strategy was used to rapidly exclude the galloylated PAs from the non-galloylated PAs and fractionate the latter according to their DP size. Then, a series of PAs with individual DP size and galloylation were purified by an approach of preparative hydrophilic interaction chromatography. Furthermore, purified compounds were identified by both normal phase HPLC-FLD and reverse phase UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF. Finally, the contribution of the astringency perception of the individual purified tannins was examined with a salivary protein binding ability test. The results were observed by HPLC-FLD and quantified by changes in PA concentration remaining in the filtrate. In summary, a new approach without a solid stationary phase was developed to isolate PAs according to their DP size. And a positive relationship between the DP of PAs and salivary protein affinity was revealed. ",1,0,1,0,0
33082403,2020,"Dalbergia is a pantropical genus with more than 250 species, many of which are highly threatened due to overexploitation for their rosewood timber, along with general deforestation. Many Dalbergia species have received international attention for conservation, but the lack of genomic resources for Dalbergia hinders evolutionary studies and conservation applications, which are important for adaptive management. This study produced the first reference transcriptomes for 6 Dalbergia species with different geographical origins and predicted ~ 32 to 49 K unique genes. We showed the utility of these transcriptomes by phylogenomic analyses with other Fabaceae species, estimating the divergence time of extant Dalbergia species to ~ 14.78 MYA. We detected over-representation in 13 Pfam terms including HSP, ALDH and ubiquitin families in Dalbergia. We also compared the gene families of geographically co-occurring D. cochinchinensis and D. oliveri and observed that more genes underwent positive selection and there were more diverged disease resistance proteins in the more widely distributed D. oliveri, consistent with reports that it occupies a wider ecological niche and has higher genetic diversity. We anticipate that the reference transcriptomes will facilitate future population genomics and gene-environment association studies on Dalbergia, as well as contributing to the genomic database where plants, particularly threatened ones, are currently underrepresented.",1,1,2,0,0
23945373,2013,"BACKGROUND:
It has been accepted that the infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) can be more heterogeneous than considered. The emergence of clonal variants caused by microevolution events leading to population heterogeneity is a phenomenon largely unexplored. Until now, we could only superficially analyze this phenomenon by standard fingerprinting (RFLP and VNTR).
METHODS:
In this study we applied whole genome sequencing for a more in-depth analysis of the scale of microevolution both at the intrapatient and interpatient scenarios.
RESULTS:
We found that the amount of variation accumulated within a patient can be as high as that observed between patients along a chain of transmission. Intrapatient diversity was found both at the extrapulmonary and respiratory sites, meaning that this variability can be transmitted and impact on the inference of transmission events. One of the events studied allowed us to track for a single strain the complete process of (i) interpatient microevolution, (ii) intrapatient respiratory variation, and (iii) isolation of different variants at different infected sites of this patient.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our study adds new data to the understanding of variability in M. tuberculosis in a wide clinical scenario and alerts about the difficulties of establishing thresholds to differentiate relatedness in M. tuberculosis with epidemiological purposes.

30005082,2018,"The obesity epidemic is a global challenge, and the velocity of propagation is high in the population at reproductive age. Overweight and obesity during pregnancy have been associated with high birth weight and an increased risk of childhood obesity, reinforcing the risk of other non-communicable diseases. Obesity involves chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. New biomarkers for early detection of obesity risk are urgently required. The aim of this study was to identify the connection between pregestational BMI (pre-BMI) status and inflammatory biomarkers during the third trimester of pregnancy and their association with intestinal microbiota composition. Fifty-four pregnant women were classified according to pre-pregnancy BMI as normoweight, overweight, or obese. Weight gain, inflammatory biomarkers (hs_CRP, haptoglobin, and suPAR), and microbiota composition were assessed during the third trimester. A significant lower weight gain for obese mothers and a positive correlation between pre-BMI and inflammatory biomarkers were detected (Spearman's correlation). Haptoglobin levels were significantly higher in overweight and obese mothers. Higher Firmicutes levels and a higher ratio Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes were observed in the overweight and obese subjects. High hs_CRP and haptoglobin levels were also correlated with decreased microbiota diversity (Shannon index), whereas haptoglobin and hs_CRP values were correlated with several microbiota components, such as Ruminococcus gnavus and Faecalibacterium, and with specific phyla in the normoweight and overweight mothers; no significant associations with microbiota were found for suPAR. In conclusion, haptoglobin and hs_CRP reflected pregestational BMI status and related microbiota components, but haptoglobin was a better biomarker for microbiota associated with overweight. suPAR was associated with low grade inflammation dependent on pre-pregnancy BMI, but it was not related to deviated microbiota profiles.",1,1,4,0,0
30949110,2019,"A growing body of research has explored well-being in diverse cultural contexts, and indicates that the definition and perception of well-being vary according to cultural context. Little is known, however, about whether intercultural differences in China (i.e., Tibetan and Han) lead to different perceptions of well-being and how social contexts and personal characteristics are associated with well-being in Tibetan and Han emerging adults. Using a self-determination framework, the current study examines the relationship between parental autonomy support (PAS) and psychological well-being (PWB) in Tibetan and Han emerging adults in China. Guided by implicit theory and self-regulatory theory, we propose a serial multiple mediation model of growth mindset and grit in the association between PAS and PWB. Propensity score matching was used to balance the two ethnic groups in terms of age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), with a ratio of one to two. Finally, 59 Tibetan (71.2% girls) and 118 Han (69.5% girls) emerging adults aged from 18 to 25 years were included in the current study, and completed an online questionnaire survey. Findings suggest that (a) Tibetan emerging adults perceived higher levels of PWB than their peers from the Han ethnic group; (b) a serial multiple mediation model for the association between PAS and PWB was supported in Han emerging adults; (c) the indirect effects between PAS and PWB varied between Tibetan and Han emerging adults. Our findings suggest that PAS and grit contribute to PWB of emerging adults in both cultural contexts, whereas growth mindset may be beneficial for Han emerging adults only.",1,1,11,2,18
10697610,1999,"OBJECTIVE:
To further evaluate lung cancer risk associated with rare Hras1 VNTR alleles and possible biological mechanisms.
METHODS:
The Hras1 VNTR was genotyped in 295 lung cancer patients and 500 healthy controls by PCR and high resolution electrophoresis. Microsatellite alterations were examined in 168 tumors by PCR and capillary electrophoresis.
RESULTS:
35 Hras1 VNTR alleles were found, of which 24 were defined as rare. A relative risk of 3.3 (95% CI; 1.9-6.0) associated with rare alleles was obtained using the total groups. Increased risk was significant both for males and females. When a matched control group was used, a relative risk of 12.7 (95% CI; 1.7-93.9) was calculated for individuals with rare alleles at the Hras1 VNTR locus. A low frequency of microsatellite alterations was observed (4.7%) in lung tumors. The frequency of altered microsatellite loci was higher among patients with rare Hras1 VNTR alleles than among patients with common alleles.
CONCLUSIONS:
Rare Hras1 VNTR alleles are associated with lung cancer risk, and a genetic mechanism which increases allelic diversity may be involved.

32094202,2020,"Human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) is critical for visual recognition. It is thought that this ability is supported by large-scale patterns of activity across VTC that contain information about visual categories. However, it is unknown how category representations in VTC are organized at the submillimeter scale and across cortical depths. To fill this gap in knowledge, we measured BOLD responses in medial and lateral VTC to images spanning 10 categories from five domains (written characters, bodies, faces, places, and objects) at an ultra-high spatial resolution of 0.8 mm using 7 Tesla fMRI in both male and female participants. Representations in lateral VTC were organized most strongly at the general level of domains (e.g., places), whereas medial VTC was also organized at the level of specific categories (e.g., corridors and houses within the domain of places). In both lateral and medial VTC, domain-level and category-level structure decreased with cortical depth, and downsampling our data to standard resolution (2.4 mm) did not reverse differences in representations between lateral and medial VTC. The functional diversity of representations across VTC partitions may allow downstream regions to read out information in a flexible manner according to task demands. These results bridge an important gap between electrophysiological recordings in single neurons at the micron scale in nonhuman primates and standard-resolution fMRI in humans by elucidating distributed responses at the submillimeter scale with ultra-high-resolution fMRI in humans.",1,1,3,0,0
24602754,2014,"OBJECTIVE:
To appraise critically the published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the effectiveness of cervical mucus removal before embryo transfer.
METHODS:
Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs.
METHODS:
Assisted reproduction technology (ART) units.
METHODS:
Women undergoing embryo transfer after in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI).
METHODS:
Cervical mucus removal followed or not by cervical irrigation immediately before embryo transfer.
METHODS:
Clinical pregnancy, implantation and live-birth rates.
RESULTS:
Eight RCTs involving 1,715 women were systematically analyzed. There was substantial heterogeneity among the included trials. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of pregnancy, implantation, or live-birth rates.
CONCLUSIONS:
A meta-analysis from the available moderate to low quality trials provides very little evidence of an overall benefit of cervical mucus removal before embryo transfer for women undergoing IVF/ICSI. Due to problems of clinical diversity, statistical heterogeneity, and risk of bias, additional pragmatic multicenter RCTs are needed to evaluate the possible small benefit of cervical mucus removal before embryo transfer.

25068389,2014,"It is often difficult to accurately predict when, why, and which patients develop shock, because signs of shock often occur late, once organ injury is already present. Three levels of aggregation of information can be used to aid the bedside clinician in this task: analysis of derived parameters of existing measured physiologic variables using simple bedside calculations (functional hemodynamic monitoring); prior physiologic data of similar subjects during periods of stability and disease to define quantitative metrics of level of severity; and libraries of responses across large and comprehensive collections of records of diverse subjects whose diagnosis, therapies, and course is already known to predict not only disease severity, but also the subsequent behavior of the subject if left untreated or treated with one of the many therapeutic options. The problem is in defining the minimal monitoring data set needed to initially identify those patients across all possible processes, and then specifically monitor their responses to targeted therapies known to improve outcome. To address these issues, multivariable models using machine learning data-driven classification techniques can be used to parsimoniously predict cardiorespiratory insufficiency. We briefly describe how these machine learning approaches are presently applied to address earlier identification of cardiorespiratory insufficiency and direct focused, patient-specific management.

26218737,2015,"BACKGROUND:
Pyrazinamide (PZA) is crucial for tuberculosis (TB) treatment, given its unique ability to eradicate persister bacilli. The worldwide burden of PZA resistance remains poorly described.
METHODS:
Systematic PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus searches for articles reporting phenotypic (liquid culture drug susceptibility testing or pyrazinamidase activity assays) and/or genotypic (polymerase chain reaction or DNA sequencing) PZA resistance. Global and regional summary estimates were obtained from random-effects meta-analysis, stratified by presence or risk of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). Regional summary estimates were combined with regional WHO TB incidence estimates to determine the annual burden of PZA resistance. Information on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pncA gene was aggregated to obtain a global summary.
RESULTS:
Pooled PZA resistance prevalence estimate was 16.2% (95% CI 11.2-21.2) among all TB cases, 41.3% (29.0-53.7) among patients at high MDR-TB risk, and 60.5% (52.3-68.6) among MDR-TB cases. The estimated global burden is 1.4 million new PZA resistant TB cases annually, about 270,000 in MDR-TB patients. Among 1,815 phenotypically resistant isolates, 608 unique SNPs occurred at 397 distinct positions throughout the pncA gene.
CONCLUSIONS:
PZA resistance is ubiquitous, with an estimated one in six incident TB cases and more than half of all MDR-TB cases resistant to PZA globally. The diversity of SNPs across the pncA gene complicates the development of rapid molecular diagnostics. These findings caution against relying on PZA in current and future TB drug regimens, especially in MDR-TB patients.

26598686,2015,"Network-based analyses of brain imaging data consistently reveal distinct modules and connector nodes with diverse global connectivity across the modules. How discrete the functions of modules are, how dependent the computational load of each module is to the other modules' processing, and what the precise role of connector nodes is for between-module communication remains underspecified. Here, we use a network model of the brain derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data and investigate the modular functional architecture of the human brain by analyzing activity at different types of nodes in the network across 9,208 experiments of 77 cognitive tasks in the BrainMap database. Using an author-topic model of cognitive functions, we find a strong spatial correspondence between the cognitive functions and the network's modules, suggesting that each module performs a discrete cognitive function. Crucially, activity at local nodes within the modules does not increase in tasks that require more cognitive functions, demonstrating the autonomy of modules' functions. However, connector nodes do exhibit increased activity when more cognitive functions are engaged in a task. Moreover, connector nodes are located where brain activity is associated with many different cognitive functions. Connector nodes potentially play a role in between-module communication that maintains the modular function of the brain. Together, these findings provide a network account of the brain's modular yet integrated implementation of cognitive functions. ",1,0,1,0,0
30557303,2018,"In multicellular organisms, cell type diversity and fate depend on specific sets of transcript isoforms generated by post-transcriptional RNA processing. Here, we used Schmidtea mediterranea, a flatworm with extraordinary regenerative abilities and a large pool of adult stem cells, as an in vivo model to study the role of Uridyl-rich small nuclear RNAs (UsnRNAs), which participate in multiple RNA processing reactions including splicing, in stem cell regulation. We characterized the planarian UsnRNA repertoire, identified stem cell-enriched variants and obtained strong evidence for an increased rate of UsnRNA 3'-processing in stem cells compared to their differentiated counterparts. Consistently, components of the Integrator complex showed stem cell-enriched expression and their depletion by RNAi disrupted UsnRNA processing resulting in global changes of splicing patterns and reduced processing of histone mRNAs. Interestingly, loss of Integrator complex function disrupted both stem cell maintenance and regeneration of tissues. Our data show that the function of the Integrator complex in UsnRNA 3'-processing is conserved in planarians and essential for maintaining their stem cell pool. We propose that cell type-specific modulation of UsnRNA composition and maturation contributes to in vivo cell fate choices, such as stem cell self-renewal in planarians.",1,1,2,0,0

25289916,2014,"BACKGROUND:
The gut microbiome plays a role in the regulation of the immune system.
METHODS:
We prospectively enrolled 26 kidney transplant recipients and collected serial fecal specimens (N=85) during the first three months of transplantation. We characterized bacterial composition by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 16S rRNA V4-V5 variable region and deep sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform.
RESULTS:
An increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was observed in the posttransplantation specimens compared to pretransplantation specimens (P=0.04, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In patients with posttransplant diarrhea, the mean(±standard deviation [SD]) Shannon diversity index was lower in those with diarrhea (N=6) than those without diarrhea (N=9) (2.5±0.3 vs. 3.4±0.8; P = 0.02, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Principal coordinate analysis showed clear separation between the two groups, and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method revealed that Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, and Dorea were significantly lower in the patients with diarrhea. Principal coordinate analysis also showed clear separation between the acute rejection (AR) group (N=3) and the no AR group (N=23) and the LEfSe method revealed significant differences between the two groups. Fecal abundance of Enterococcus was associated with Enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI). The median Enterococcus fecal abundance was 24% (range, 8%-95%) in the three patients with Enterococcus UTI compared to 0% in the 23 patients without Enterococcus UTI (interquartile range, 0.00%-0.08%) (P=0.005, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).

We analysed the microbiota in menstrual fluids extracted from tampons from 108 healthy women and 7 mTSS cases. Using culture, S. aureus was detected in menstrual fluids of 40% of healthy volunteers and 100% of mTSS patients. Between class analysis of culturomic and 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding data indicated that the composition of the tampons' microbiota differs according to the presence or absence of S. aureus and identify discriminating genera. However, the bacterial communities of tampon fluid positive for S. aureus did not cluster together. No difference in tampon microbiome richness, diversity, and ecological distance was observed between tampon vaginal fluids with or without S. aureus, and between healthy donors carrying S. aureus and mTSS patients.
